Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House or Senate Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRYThis title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).Subtitle A--Nutrition(Sec. 10101)&nbsp;This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.As background, USDA created the TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.(Sec. 10102)&nbsp;This section expands the applicability of work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs).As background, these SNAP recipients have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements. SNAP law limits benefits to ABAWDs to 3 months out of a 36-month period, unless the participant meets the additional work-related requirements.&nbsp;Specifically, the section amends the exemptions to this requirement.First, the section applies the work requirements for ABAWDs to adults who are not over 65 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.Second, the ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted to&nbsp;a dependent child under the age of 14. Currently, those with a child&nbsp;under the age of 18 are exempt from the requirements.This section includes an exception for individuals who are Indians, Urban Indians, or California Indians (as these terms are defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act).&nbsp;In addition, the section eliminates the current exemptions from the ABAWD work requirements for homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals (those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age).Finally, this section modifies the ABAWD waiver program's allowable state exemptions. Under current law, an ABAWD waiver program allows state exemptions based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs. The section allows Alaska and Hawaii to qualify for the state exemption with an unemployment rate that is at or above 1.5 times the national unemployment rate.&nbsp;Further, the section repeals the provision that allows a state exemption if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.(Sec. 10103)&nbsp;This section limits the availability of the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) for determining SNAP income eligibility. Specifically, only households that include an elderly or disabled member may be considered automatically eligible for the SUA based on participation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program.As background, when determining a household’s eligibility for SNAP, states consider the total shelter costs for a household, including the cost of utilities. States can use SUAs, which are standard amounts that represent low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Currently, all LIHEAP participants who receive a minimum benefit are eligible for the SUA for determining SNAP income eligibility.(Sec.10104) This section prohibits any service fee associated with an internet connection&nbsp; from being used in computing the excess shelter expense deduction for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits.(Sec. 10105) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments&nbsp;beginning in FY2028. The state contribution ranges from 0% to 15% for the cost of SNAP program allotments and is based on the state’s SNAP payment error rate. Currently, the state match is 0%.For FY2028, a state may elect either the FY2025 or FY2026 payment error rate to calculate its state-matching fund requirement. For FY2029 and each fiscal year thereafter, the state match is calculated using the payment error rate that is three fiscal years prior.Any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% will have a state match of 0% (i.e., the state does not have to contribute).A state with a payment error rate that isat least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 5%,at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 10%, and10% or greater must contribute 15%.(Sec. 10106) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs&nbsp;beginning in FY2027 and for each fiscal year thereafter. Currently, USDA must pay 50%&nbsp;of all administrative costs, thus this section increases&nbsp;the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.(Sec. 10107)&nbsp;This section eliminates&nbsp;funding for&nbsp;the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED).(Sec. 10108) This section limits SNAP benefits to individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals; (2) aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence as an immigrant, with exceptions; (3) aliens who have been granted the status of Cuban or Haitian entrant; or (4) individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.Currently, SNAP eligibility extends to additional individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law, including an alien who has qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws.Subtitle B-- Forestry(Sec. 10201) This section rescinds certain funds provided to the Forest Service as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. For example, this includes the rescission of funds for&nbsp;the protection of old-growth forests on National Forest System land,grants for nonfederal forest landowners for climate mitigation or forest resilience practices,grants for state and private forestry conservation programs for tree planting, andadministrative costs for the National Forest System to implement these and other related programs.Subtitle C--CommoditiesThis subtitle amends and extends commodity support programs.For example, the subtitle extends the Price Loss Coverage Program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, and Dairy Margin Coverage through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.(Sec. 10313) This section provides for a number of changes to Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), which includechanging the definition of production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;setting production history for the&nbsp;DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;raising the coverage limit to the first 6 million pounds for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first 5 million pounds; andallowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.Subtitle D--Disaster Assistance ProgramsThis subtitle expands the types of eligible losses covered under the permanently authorized agricultural disaster assistance programs, which include the Livestock Indemnity Program; the Livestock Forage Disaster Program; the&nbsp;Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program; and the&nbsp;Tree Assistance Program. This subtitle also increases coverage levels and lowers the threshold for triggering payments for certain eligible losses.Subtitle&nbsp;E--Crop InsuranceThis subtitle increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies and increases additional premium subsidies available for beginning farmers and ranchers. The subtitle also increases coverage levels for Supplemental Coverage Option and Whole Farm Revenue Protection policies, increases support for administrative and operating costs incurred by approved crop insurance providers, and increases funds available for program compliance and integrity.In addition, this subtitle&nbsp;provides for the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program in order to provide index-based insurance for contract poultry growers.Subtitle F--Additional Investments in Rural America&nbsp;(Sec. 10601) This section reauthorizes or modifies the funding levels for the following programs through FY2031:Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP),Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP),Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP),Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP),Grassroots Source Water Protection Program,Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program,Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program, andFeral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program.This section also rescinds the unobligated funds that were provided for the ACEP, EQIP, CSP, and RCPP conservation programs as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.(Sec. 10602)&nbsp;This section directs USDA to carry out a program to encourage the accessibility, development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. This section also provides $285 million in mandatory funding for the program for FY2027 and each fiscal year thereafter.(Sec. 10603)&nbsp;This section extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).(Sec. 10604)&nbsp;This section reauthorizes and provides funding for a number of USDA research initiatives.For example, this section provides specified funds to the 1890 National Scholars Program for FY2026 for student scholarships. This National Institute of Food and Agriculture program provides grants to 1890 Institutions (i.e., historically Black colleges and universities that belong to the U.S. land-grant university system) for students who intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.This section provides the Specialty Crop Research Initiative with $175 million in mandatory funding for FY2026. Currently, the program is funded at $80 million for each fiscal year.This section also provides funding for competitive grants to assist in the construction, alteration, acquisition, modernization, renovation, or remodeling of Agricultural Research Facilities.(Sec. 10605)&nbsp;This section reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels (i.e., Advanced Biofuel Payment Program) through FY2031. The program provides payments to fuel producers to support and expand production of advanced biofuels (i.e., not derived from corn starch).(Sec. 10606)&nbsp;This section provides additional funding for the Plant Pest and Disease Management Disaster Prevention Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter.This section provides additional funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter. Under the block grant program, USDA provides grants to the state departments of agriculture to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops (i.e., fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, including floriculture).The section also reauthorizes, and extends funding for, organic production and market data initiatives through FY2031.This section reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for USDA to carry out the modernization and improvement of international trade technology systems and data collection on imports of organically produced agricultural products accepted into the United States.The section also reauthorizes&nbsp;through FY2031&nbsp;the Organic Certification Cost Share Program, which provides cost share assistance to producers and handlers of agricultural products who are obtaining or renewing their certification under the National Organic Program.This section reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for the multiple crop and pesticide use survey of farmers. The USDA Office of Pest Management Policy conducts this survey to collect data for risk assessment modeling and mitigation for an active ingredient.(Sec. 10607) This section increases funding for the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. Specific increases in funding are also provided for the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and the National Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank.This section extends and increases funding for the Sheep Production &amp; Marketing Grant Program through FY2026. This program seeks to strengthen and enhance the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.This section also extends thePima Agriculture Cotton Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on cotton fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of cotton fabric;Agriculture Wool Apparel Manufacturers Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on wool fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of wool fabric;Wool Research and Promotion Program through FY2031, which provides grants to assist U.S. wool producers with improving the quality of wool and with developing and promoting the wool market; andEmergency Citrus Disease Research and Development Trust Fund through FY2031, which funds a program that aims to bring together scientists to find scientifically sound and financially sustainable solutions to Huanglongbing (i.e., citrus greening, a bacterial disease spread by an insect that feeds on citrus).TITLE II--COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES(Sec. 20001) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to the Department of Defense (DOD) forthe Marine Corps Barracks 2030 initiative,the Defense Health Program,supplemental payments of Basic Allowance for Housing to military personnel, andtuition assistance and child care assistance for members of the Armed Forces.The section also provides statutory authority to extend from 14 to 21 days eligibility for Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) for certain servicemembers undergoing a permanent change of station.Additionally, the section temporarily increases authorized investment amounts and provides additional authorization for the acquisition or construction of certain military housing through private contracts.(Sec. 20002) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the shipbuilding industrial base and various naval shipbuilding activities.&nbsp;(Sec. 20003) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the development of (1) space-based missile intercept capabilities, (2) military space-based sensors, and (3) the continued development of ground-based missile defense systems and related infrastructure.(Sec. 20004) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for various military weapon systems, including hypersonic, air-to-air, cruise, and anti-ship missiles.The section also provides additional funding for FY2025 for the Industrial Base Fund.(Sec. 20005) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to expand the small, unmanned aerial system (UAS) industrial base, to advance the use of artificial intelligence in these and other systems, and to support the integration of commercial developments in military technology.The section also provides additional funding to finance loans and loan guarantees by the DOD Office of Strategic Capital.(Sec. 20006) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to replace current business systems, deploy automation, and deploy artificial intelligence to accelerate audits of DOD financial statements.(Sec. 20007) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to (1) modernize the capabilities of fighter, transport, and other military aircraft; (2) prevent the retirement of certain fighter aircraft (e.g., F-22); and (3) produce next-generation manned and unmanned aircraft.(Sec. 20008) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for nuclear defense resources and nuclear forces development and production.&nbsp;This includes additional funding to expand the production capacity of the B-21 long-range bomber aircraft.The section also provides additional funding for FY2025 for&nbsp;the National Nuclear Security Administration.(Sec. 20009) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for (1) various military exercises and infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region, and (2) the development and procurement of military&nbsp;satellites.(Sec. 20010) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to enhance and modernize (1) military depots and shipyards, (2) Special Operations Command (SOCOM) equipment, and (3) Air Force facilities.&nbsp;(Sec. 20011) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to support border operations, including deployment of military personnel.(Sec. 20012) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the DOD Office of Inspector General to monitor the activities for which funding is provided under this title.(Sec. 20013) This section authorizes each military department to use funding under this title for military construction, land acquisition, and military family housing.

(The FCC’s auction authority must be renewed by Congress periodically. It expired on March 9, 2023, and has not been renewed.)&nbsp;However, the FCC is not authorized to auction certain frequencies used primarily by the Department of Defense.During this period of renewed auction authority, the FCC is required to auction at least 300 megahertz of spectrum, including at least 100 megahertz in specified frequencies (known as the Upper C-Band) within two years of this title’s enactment.Further, within four years of this title’s enactment, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) must identify 500 megahertz of additional&nbsp;spectrum currently allocated to the federal government for reallocation and auction. Specifically, the NTIA must select spectrum&nbsp;at frequencies between 1.3 and 10.5 gigahertz for reallocation to nonfederal use or shared federal use for full-power commercial licensed use cases (e.g., commercial mobile phone service). In selecting spectrum for reallocation, the NTIA must assess the feasibility of reallocating specific frequencies with the goal of maximizing auction proceeds.The FCC must auction the frequencies identified for reallocation within a specified time frame, and must complete auctions for the full 500 megahertz within eight years of this title’s enactment.&nbsp;If necessary to protect U.S. national security, the President must modify or withdraw any frequency identified for reallocation at least 60 days before an auction of that frequency.Finally, this section provides funding for the NTIA to conduct a timely spectrum analysis of certain frequency bands and to publish a report, biennially through 2034, on the value of all spectrum used by federal entities.(Sec. 40003) This section provides the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with specified funds for FY2025, to remain available through FY2029.

This section provides funding to NASA to carry out this requirement, including certain funds that must be transferred to a selected entity for the construction of a facility to house the space vehicle.(Sec. 40006) This section sets the civil penalty to $0 for a violation by a manufacturer of the&nbsp;Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard.&nbsp;Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA’s) CAFE standards regulate how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. NHTSA enforces the standards through civil penalties. By reducing the penalty to $0, this section effectively eliminates the civil penalty and the ability of&nbsp;NHTSA to enforce the standards.(Sec. 40007) This section increases the amount of the lease payment that the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) must pay&nbsp;to the federal government for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport.&nbsp;Specifically, MWAA must pay $15 million per year (adjusted annually for inflation) beginning in 2027. This amount must be renegotiated at least once every 10 years to ensure that the amount is not less than $15 million in 2027 dollars. Under current law,&nbsp;MWAA pays $3 million per year (adjusted annually for inflation). For 2025, the projected payment is approximately $7.5 million.(Sec. 40008) This section rescinds specified funds that were provided to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for certain facilities, activities, and research.Specifically, this section rescinds funds that were provided to&nbsp;NOAA for (1) the provision of financial or technical assistance to coastal states and other entities for conservation, restoration, and protection of coastal and marine habitats and to enable preparation for extreme weather; (2) NOAA facilities, including piers, fisheries laboratories, and national marine sanctuaries; (3) reviews of planning, permitting, and approval processes; and (4) weather research and forecasting innovations, including a grant program to support climate research.(Sec. 40009) This section reduces funding for the&nbsp;Corporation for Travel Promotion (i.e.,&nbsp;Brand USA) to $20 million per year through FY2027 from the current level of $100 million per year.

However, under this section, taxpayers must continue to capitalize and amortize over a 15-year period foreign research and experimental expenses.Under this section, taxpayers may elect to capitalize and amortize over at least 60 months domestic research and experimental expenses. (Some exclusions apply.)Further, under this section (1) small business taxpayers (with average annual gross receipts of $31 million or less) may claim a tax deduction for domestic research and experimental expenses retroactively to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, and (2) taxpayers may elect to accelerate amortization attributable to domestic research and experimental expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 2021 and before January 1, 2025.(Sec. 70303) This section reinstates the exclusion of the tax deduction for depreciation, amortization, or depletion from the calculation of adjusted taxable income for purposes of the limitation on the tax deduction for interest expenses for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.This section also expands the exclusion of interest on floor plan financing from the limit on the tax deduction for business interest expenses to include interest on floor plan financing of any camper or trailer designed to (1) provide temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, or seasonal use; and (2) be towed by, or affixed to, a motor vehicle.(Sec. 70306) This section increases to $2.5 million (from $1.25 million in 2025 and adjusted annually for inflation) the maximum amount that may be deducted (expensed) for certain depreciable business assets.

(Some limitations apply.)(Sec. 70322) This section excludes from deduction-eligible income for purposes of calculating foreign-derived intangible income (and the tax deduction for such income) income or gain from the sale or other disposition (including the deemed sale or other disposition) occurring after June 16, 2025, of (1) property of a type that gives rise to rents or royalties, and (2) any other property that is subject to depreciation, amortization, or depletion by the seller of such property.Further, under this section, deduction-eligible income must be reduced by expenses and deductions directly related to such income.(Sec. 70323) This section eliminates the use of a domestic corporation’s deemed tangible income return in determining foreign-derived intangible income and such corporation’s net deemed tangible income return in determining GILTI. As a result, under this section, the term foreign-derived intangible income is renamed foreign-derived deduction eligible income and the term GILTI is renamed net CFC tested income. (In this context, CFC refers to controlled foreign corporation.)Part III--Base Erosion Minimum TaxThis part makes changes to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT).Below is a summary of the provision in this part.(Sec. 70331) This section decreases the BEAT rate to 10.5% (from 12.5%) for tax years beginning after 2025.

Under this section, such organizations are required to issue Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $20,000 from more than 200 separate transactions. (This section reverses a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that lowered the reporting threshold to $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions, the implementation of which was delayed and phased in by the IRS. For 2025, under current law, such organizations are required to issue IRS Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $2,500, regardless of the number of transactions.)(Sec. 70434) This section expands the federal tax deduction for certain film, television, and theatrical production costs to allow a deduction of up to $150,000 of qualified sound recording production costs in the tax year such costs are incurred.

The section precludes states that have not expanded Medicaid from increasing the rate of a provider tax beyond that currently in effect in order to qualify for federal matching funds. For states that have expanded Medicaid, a provider tax may not exceed the current rate or a specified rate, whichever is lower; the maximum rate gradually decreases from FY2028-FY2032, with a maximum rate of 3.5% beginning in FY2032 (these limits do not apply to nursing and intermediate care facilities, which are instead limited to current rates). The section additionally precludes states from imposing a new provider tax if there is not already one in effect.The section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71116) This section provides funds through FY2033 for the CMS to revise regulations so as to limit state-directed payments for inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, or qualified practitioner services at an academic medical center under Medicaid managed care contracts to the payment rate for services under Medicare, rather than the average commercial rate.

States may not waive the new requirements. However, states may choose to provide an exception for individuals experiencing short-term hardships (e.g., hospitalization).The section excludes certain individuals from these requirements, including those with serious medical conditions or dependent children aged 13 or younger.&nbsp;Upon request, the CMS may exempt a state from fully implementing these requirements until December 31, 2028.

         "This act reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by several congressional committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House or Senate Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts.

Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.As background, USDA created the TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.(Sec. 10102) This section increases the work requirements for certain SNAP recipients&nbsp;who are able-bodied adults.As background,&nbsp;SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) currently have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements. SNAP law limits benefits to ABAWDs to 3 months out of a 36-month period, unless the participant meets the additional work-related requirements.This section raises the age for those who must meet these additional work requirements to include adults who are 65 years old and younger, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are 55 years old and younger.This section requires parents and household members to meet the additional work requirements (similar to someone who does not have a dependent child) if the child is age 14 and older. Currently, those with a child under the age of 18 are exempt from the requirements.This section&nbsp;excludes from the additional work requirements SNAP recipients who are Indians, Urban Indians, or California Indians (as these terms are defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act).&nbsp;In addition, the section generally requires homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals&nbsp;to meet these work requirements. Foster care individuals are&nbsp;those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age.&nbsp;Specifically, this section eliminates the current exclusion from the additional work requirements for these individuals based on this status.Finally, this section limits the ability of a state to temporarily suspend the three-month time limit for SNAP benefits for ABAWDS in areas with high unemployment or an insufficient number of jobs. Under current law, the ABAWD waiver program allows states to request a temporary waiver of the three-month SNAP benefit limit. States may receive a waiver based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs.The section repeals the provision that allows a state waiver if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs. Further, the section allows Alaska and Hawaii to qualify for the state exemption with an unemployment rate that is at or above 1.5 times the national unemployment rate, effectively lowering the unemployment rate that these states must meet to receive a waiver.&nbsp;(Sec. 10103) This section generally eliminates the ability of a household to use participation in certain energy assistance programs to determine SNAP income eligibility unless&nbsp;the household includes an elderly or disabled member.&nbsp;As background, a household may deduct a portion of their housing and utility costs from their income (i.e., the excess shelter expense deduction) when determining SNAP benefits. Under current law, a household that receives a certain level of energy assistance through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program may deduct a set allowance. This set allowance&nbsp;(i.e., Standard Utility Allowance or SUA) represents low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Using this allowance makes qualifying for an excess shelter deduction more likely.This section&nbsp;eliminates the use of the set allowance for households without elderly or disabled members, which may decrease the availability of the excess shelter deduction and reduce the SNAP benefits for these households.(Sec.&nbsp;10104)&nbsp;This section prohibits a household from using any internet connection service fees as part of their housing and utility costs for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits, thus potentially reducing the SNAP benefits for these households.As background, a household may deduct a portion of their housing and utility costs from their income (i.e., the excess shelter expense&nbsp;deduction) when determining SNAP benefits.&nbsp;Under current law, household expenses may include&nbsp;internet connection service fees.(Sec. 10105) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments&nbsp;beginning in FY2028. The state contribution ranges from 0% to 15% for the cost of SNAP program allotments and is based on the state’s SNAP payment error rate. Currently, the state match is 0%.For FY2028, a state may elect either the FY2025 or FY2026 payment error rate to calculate its state-matching fund requirement. For FY2029 and each fiscal year thereafter, the state match is calculated using the payment error rate for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the state share is being calculated.Any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% will have a state match of 0% (i.e., the state does not have to contribute).&nbsp;A state with a payment error rate that isat least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 5%,at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 10%, and10% or greater must contribute 15%.In general,&nbsp;the&nbsp;effective date for the state-matching fund requirements&nbsp;is the beginning of FY2028. However, any state that has an error rate above a certain level will have implementation delayed until FY2029 or&nbsp;FY2030. Specifically, the implementation date is delayed for states where the state's error rate multiplied by 1.5 equals or exceeds 20% in FY2025 or FY2026. For such states, the implementation date is delayed until FY2029 if the specified error rate occurs in FY2025 and until FY2030 if the error rate occurs in FY2026.&nbsp;(Sec. 10106) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs beginning in FY2027 and for each fiscal year thereafter. Currently, USDA must pay 50% of all administrative costs, thus this section increases the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.(Sec. 10107) This section eliminates funding for the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED). SNAP state and local agencies administer this federal grant program. SNAP-Ed uses evidence-based, public health projects and interventions with the goal to implement a nutrition education and obesity prevention program for eligible individuals that promotes healthy food choices and physical activity consistent with the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans.(Sec. 10108) This section&nbsp;eliminates SNAP eligibility for certain individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law and legally present in the United States, including those who have qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws or&nbsp;based on urgent humanitarian&nbsp;reasons (e.g., a&nbsp;survivor of domestic violence or human trafficking).The section maintains SNAP eligibility for&nbsp;individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals; (2) lawful permanent residents, with exceptions; (3) aliens who are Cuban or Haitian&nbsp;entrants; or (4) individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and&nbsp;Palau.Subtitle B-- Forestry(Sec. 10201) This section rescinds certain funds provided to the Forest Service as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. For example, this includes the rescission of funds for&nbsp;the protection of old-growth forests on National Forest System land,grants for nonfederal forest landowners for climate mitigation or forest resilience practices,grants for state and private forestry conservation programs for tree planting, andadministrative costs for the National Forest System to implement these and other related programs.Subtitle C--CommoditiesThis subtitle amends and extends commodity support programs.For example, the subtitle extends the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC)&nbsp; program, and Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.(Sec. 10301) This section increases the reference prices for specified commodities under the ARC and&nbsp;PLC programs for crop years 2025 through 2030. This change would increase the likelihood of triggering a payment and increase the payments made to eligible producers when triggered.Beginning in crop year 2031, USDA must increase the reference price so that it is equal to the reference price in the previous crop year multiplied by 1.005. USDA must continue to increase the reference price using this formula for each crop year after 2031, up to a maximum of 113% of the 2030 reference price.The ARC and&nbsp;PLC programs, administered by the Farm Service Agency, offer financial assistance to eligible agricultural producers, and the reference prices are used to calculate benefits under the programs.&nbsp;The ARC program is an income support program that provides payments to producers triggered when actual crop revenue declines below a specified guarantee level. The&nbsp;PLC program provides income support payments triggered when the effective price for a covered commodity falls below its effective reference price.(Sec. 10302) This section grants eligible agricultural producers a one-time option to expand and allocate base acre holdings in proportion to average 2019-2023 plantings of covered and&nbsp;noncovered commodities. In general, the Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage programs make payments per enrolled base acre (i.e., a unit of production associated with specific tracts of farmland in proportion to historical production of certain crops).This section allows producers to allocate existing unassigned base acres to a covered commodity. The section limits the total existing unassigned and newly granted base acres to no more than 30 million acres, effectively increasing total base acres nationwide from approximately 274 million to approximately 304 million.(Sec. 10303)&nbsp;This section requires producers to make an election to obtain ARC or PLC on a covered-commodity-by-covered commodity basis through crop year 2031.&nbsp;For the 2025 crop year, this section requires USDA, on a covered commodity-by-covered commodity basis, to make the higher of PLC payments or ARC county coverage payments to the producers on a farm for the payment acres for each covered commodity on the&nbsp;farm.(Sec. 10304) This section extends the&nbsp;PLC program through crop year 2031.(Sec. 10305) This section extends the ARC program through the 2031 crop year. It also increases the coverage guarantee level from 86% to 90% of the benchmark revenue and increases the maximum payment amount&nbsp;from 10% to 12.5% of the&nbsp;benchmark revenue. These changes increase the likelihood of triggering a payment and increase the payments made to eligible producers when triggered. &nbsp;(Sec. 10306) This section establishes a definition for a qualified pass-through entity, which includes certain partnerships and S corporations (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) and certain limited liability companies, joint ventures, and general partnerships. It also generally requires these entities to be treated in the same manner as current law treats general partnerships and joint ventures for the purpose of payment limitations. For example, the section replaces an existing exception to payment limitations for joint ventures and general partnerships with an exception for qualified pass-through entities.(Sec. 10307) This section increases the maximum ARC and&nbsp;PLC&nbsp;payment limit per person from $125,000 to $155,000. A producer is eligible to receive up to $155,000 in peanut payments and up to $155,000 in payments for all commodities except peanuts (i.e., up to $310,000 total for all commodities inclusive). USDA must adjust payment limits for inflation annually beginning with the 2025 crop year.As background, certain payment limits and eligibility criteria apply to multiple farm programs, including ARC,&nbsp;PLC, and certain disaster assistance programs and conservation programs.(Sec. 10308) This section waives the adjusted gross income (AGI) limitations for payments or benefits under certain USDA disaster assistance and conservation programs for a person or legal entity that derives a portion of their income from agriculture. Specifically, the exception allows producers and business entities whose AGI exceeds $900,000 to participate in certain disaster assistance and conservation programs if 75% or more of their AGI (i.e., gross income before applying adjustments to calculate the AGI) is derived from eligible agricultural activities.The eligible activities are farming, ranching, or siviculture activities, including&nbsp;agritourism, direct-to-consumer marketing of agricultural products, and the sale of agricultural equipment owned by such person or entity.(Sec. 10309) This section extends the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program nonrecourse and recourse loans through the 2031 crop year. It also sets MAL rates for crop years 2026-2031. This section also extends Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs) through the 2031 crop year. The MAL and LDP programs provide price support to producers when market prices drop below statutory levels.This section also extends the Special Competitive Provisions for Extra Long Staple (ELS) Cotton program. This program makes payments to eligible mills that use ELS cotton and eligible exporters of ELS cotton.As background, there are two main species of cotton cultivated for commercial use, upland cotton (which comprises 97% of U.S. production) and extra-long staple (ELS) cotton. U.S.-grown ELS cotton is also referred to as Pima cotton.(Sec. 10310) This section changes how world prices for upland and ELS cotton are calculated for the purpose of repaying&nbsp;MALs.(Sec. 10311) This section increases the payments to domestic users of upland cotton who participate in the Economic Adjustment Assistance for Textile Mills program. This program makes monthly payments to eligible domestic cotton mills. The payments must be used for capital investments that contribute to domestic manufacturing of upland cotton.(Sec. 10312) This section makes several modification to USDA's sugar program.&nbsp;As background, the U.S. sugar program supports the U.S. sugar industry (i.e., producers and processors of sugarcane and sugar beets) by providing Marketing Assistance Loans (MALs) to sugar processors, restricting domestic supply of sugar with marketing allotments for sugar processors, and limiting sugar imports through tariff-rate quotas.Specifically, this section increases the marketing loan rate for raw sugar cane processors and increases the rate for beet sugar processors for crop years 2025-2031.This section also increases the storage rates USDA pays to processors for forfeited refined sugar and forfeited raw cane sugar. Under current law, when sugar is used to&nbsp;collateralize a MAL loan and is forfeited by a sugar processor, USDA must provide payments to the processors who store the forfeited sugar.This section extends the provisions for the flexible marketing allotments for sugar through crop year 2031. In addition, in operating sugar support programs, USDA must prioritize sugar beet processors if marketing allotments are adjusted higher. Additionally, if sugar beet marketing allotments need to be adjusted, USDA must reassign sugar beet marketing allotments within 30 days of the publication of USDA's January World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report.&nbsp;Finally, USDA must study whether the establishment of additional terms and conditions with respect to refined sugar imports is necessary and appropriate and submit a report to Congress. Based on the study, USDA may issue regulations to establish additional terms and conditions for refined sugar imports.(Sec. 10313) This section extends Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) through crop year 2031 and provides for a number of changes to the DMC program.As background, DMC allows participating milk producers to buy a guaranteed margin for their milk production.&nbsp;The DMC program pays participating producers the difference between a producer-selected guarantee and the national milk margin (all-milk price minus an average feed cost ration). Margin payments are based on producers' milk production history, not actual milk marketings (i.e., quantity of milk sold). Producers pay annual premium rates based on two tiers of production history.Changes to the program includealtering how USDA determines&nbsp;production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;setting production history for the DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;raising the coverage limit to the first 6 million pounds of production history for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first 5 million pounds; andallowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.(Sec. 10314)&nbsp; This section requires USDA to make available specified funds to carry out this subtitle. It also requires USDA to use specified funds to administer a mandatory survey of dairy product manufacturers' production costs and product yield information. USDA must&nbsp;publish the results of the surveys&nbsp;biennially.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subtitle D--Disaster Assistance ProgramsThis subtitle expands the types of eligible losses covered under the permanently authorized agricultural disaster assistance programs, which include the Livestock Indemnity Program; the Livestock Forage Disaster Program; the&nbsp;Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program; and the&nbsp;Tree Assistance Program. This subtitle also increases coverage levels and lowers the threshold for triggering payments for certain eligible losses.(Sec. 10401) Under the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), this section increases the payment rate to 100%, from 75%, for losses due to predation (i.e., attacks by animals reintroduced into the wild by the federal government or protected by federal law). This section also authorizes USDA to allow eligible producers to submit documentation to assist in determining an animal's market value. Further, the section expands LIP coverage to include unborn livestock as LIP- eligible livestock losses. LIP provides indemnity payments to eligible livestock owners and contract growers for livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality or reduced sales prices due to specified events (e.g., adverse weather, disease, or animal attack).Under the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), this section expands the types of eligible drought conditions covered and increases payments for certain eligible drought conditions under the program. The LFP program makes payments to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses due to&nbsp;drought-affected pastureland&nbsp;or a fire on federally managed rangelands.Under the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), this section expands eligible losses to include bird predation of farm-raised fish and adds an eligible loss threshold when determining honey bee colony losses. ELAP provides payments to producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish as compensation for losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, or other conditions that are not covered under other programs.Under the Tree Assistance Program (TAP), this section lowers the eligible normal mortality loss threshold and increases assistance for eligible rehabilitation costs. TAP provides financial assistance to qualifying orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate eligible trees, bushes, and vines damaged by natural disasters.Subtitle&nbsp;E--Crop InsuranceThis subtitle increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies and increases additional premium subsidies available for beginning farmers and ranchers. The subtitle also increases coverage levels for Supplemental Coverage Option&nbsp;(i.e., a type of county-level coverage) and Whole Farm Revenue Protection policies, increases support for administrative and operating (A&amp;O) costs incurred by approved crop insurance providers, and increases funds available for program compliance and integrity.As background, the Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP) offers subsidized crop insurance policies that producers can purchase to cover a wide variety of crops and livestock. These policies pay indemnities for yield and revenue losses caused by adverse growing and market conditions, including natural disasters. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)—a government corporation within USDA—subsidizes part of the policy premium.(Sec. 10501) This section increases the premium subsidies available for beginning farmers or ranchers for an applicable insurance policy or plan.Further, farmers and ranchers are eligible to qualify for the program for 10 years, an increase from 5 years. Specifically, a farmer or rancher must not have actively operated and managed a farm or ranch for more than 10 crop years to be considered a beginning farmer or rancher.&nbsp;(Sec. 10502) This section expands the maximum coverage level from 85% to 90% for individual yield or revenue coverage aggregated across multiple commodities (e.g., Whole-Farm Revenue Protection policies). &nbsp;The section also expands the&nbsp;Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) and increases SCO premium subsidies from 65% to 80%. It also increases the SCO coverage level from 86% to 90%.(Sec. 10503) This section increases administrative and operating (A&amp;O) subsidies in certain states and years with relatively high losses.As background, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) subsidizes part of the policy premium. The policyholders (i.e., farmers and ranchers)&nbsp;pay any remaining premium. Private insurance companies&nbsp;sell and service the policies in return for A&amp;O subsidies from the FCIC.This section also establishes a minimum A&amp;O reimbursement&nbsp;rate for specialty crop policies&nbsp;each year beginning in the 2026 reinsurance year. The rate must be equal to or greater than the percentage that is the greater of (1) 17% of the premium used to define loss ratio, and (2) the percentage of the premium used to define loss ratio that is otherwise applicable for the reinsurance year under the terms of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement in effect for the reinsurance year.Finally, beginning with the 2026 reinsurance year, the section requires&nbsp;USDA to annually increase the total A&amp;O reimbursements that would otherwise be required in order to account for inflation.(Sec. 10504) This section increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies. The increases range from 3% to 5%, depending on the coverage level.(Sec. 10505) This section increases funding for available information technologies (i.e., data mining and data warehousing) to administer and enforce program compliance and integrity.(Sec. 10506) This section increases funding for (1) the operations and review of policies, plans of insurance, and related materials; and&nbsp;(2) maintaining program actuarial soundness and financial integrity.&nbsp;(Sec. 10507) This section provides for the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program to provide contract poultry growers with&nbsp;index-based insurance for&nbsp;extreme weather-related risk resulting in increased utility costs&nbsp;associated with poultry production. Under an index policy, claim payments are generally triggered based on a predetermined index that is entirely independent of the individual farm operation (e.g., rainfall level). Under such a policy, the payments are automatically triggered when the index reaches a certain level rather than when an insured farmer files a claim.Subtitle F--Additional Investments in Rural America&nbsp;(Sec. 10601) This section rescinds the unobligated funds that were provided for the Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), and the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP)&nbsp; as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The section also adds funds to the&nbsp;permanent farm bill baseline for these programs. It also reauthorizes or modifies the funding levels for various other conservation programs.The section provides the following funding levels for ACEP:$625 million for FY2026,$650 million for FY2027,$675 million for FY2028, and$700 million for each of FY2029-FY2031.The section provides the following funding levels for EQIP:$2.655 billion for FY2026,$2.855 billion for FY2027, and$3.255 billion for each of FY2028-FY2031.The section provides the following funding&nbsp;levels for CSP:$1.300 billion for FY2026,$1.325 billion for FY2027,$1.350 billion for FY2028, and$1.375 billion for each of FY2029-FY2031.The section provides the following funding levels&nbsp; for RCPP:$425 million for FY2026, and$450 million each of FY2027-FY2031.In addition, this section reauthorizes or modifies the funding levels for the following programsGrassroots Source Water Protection Program,Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program,Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program, andFeral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program.(Sec. 10602)&nbsp;This section directs USDA to carry out a program to encourage the accessibility, development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. This section also provides $285 million in mandatory funding for the program for FY2027 and each fiscal year thereafter.(Sec. 10603)&nbsp;This section extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).&nbsp;Through TEFAP, USDA purchases a variety of commodities and makes those food products (e.g., canned, frozen, dried, and fresh fruits and vegetables; eggs; meat; dairy; and whole-grain and enriched grain products) available to state distributing agencies.(Sec. 10604)&nbsp;This section reauthorizes and provides funding for a number of USDA research initiatives.The section reauthorizes and extends funding through FY2031 for the Urban, Indoor, and other Emerging Agricultural Production Research, Education, and Extension Initiative, a National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) competitive grant program that supports research, education, and extension activities that facilitate development of urban, indoor, and other emerging agricultural production systems.The section provides $37 million for the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, a nonprofit corporation established to advance the research mission of USDA by supporting research activities focused on key problems of national and international significance.The section provides specified funds to the 1890 National Scholars Program for FY2026 for student scholarships. This NIFA program provides grants to 1890 Institutions (i.e., historically Black colleges and universities that belong to the U.S. land-grant university system) for students who intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.The section provides funding for the&nbsp;Assistive Technology Program for Farmers with Disabilities Program (AgrAbility) grant program for FY2026. This NIFA program supports&nbsp;projects that provide&nbsp;agricultural education and assistance to farmers with disabilities&nbsp;and their family members.This section provides the Specialty Crop Research Initiative with $175 million in mandatory funding for FY2026. Currently, the program is funded at $80 million for each fiscal year.This section also provides funding for competitive grants to assist in the construction, alteration, acquisition, modernization, renovation, or remodeling of Agricultural Research Facilities.(Sec. 10605)&nbsp;This section reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels (i.e., Advanced Biofuel Payment Program) through FY2031. The program provides payments to fuel producers to support and expand production of advanced biofuels (i.e., not derived from corn starch).(Sec. 10606)&nbsp;This section provides additional funding for the Plant Pest and Disease Management Disaster Prevention Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter.This section provides additional funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter. Under the block grant program, USDA provides grants to the state departments of agriculture to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops (i.e., fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, including floriculture).The section also reauthorizes, and extends funding for, organic production and market data initiatives through FY2031.This section reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for USDA to carry out the modernization and improvement of international trade technology systems and data collection on imports of organically produced agricultural products accepted into the United States.The section also reauthorizes&nbsp;through FY2031&nbsp;the Organic Certification Cost Share Program, which provides cost share assistance to producers and handlers of agricultural products who are obtaining or renewing their certification under the National Organic Program.This section reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for the multiple crop and pesticide use survey of farmers. The USDA Office of Pest Management Policy conducts this survey to collect data for risk assessment modeling and mitigation for an active ingredient.(Sec. 10607) This section increases mandatory&nbsp;funding for the National Animal Health Laboratory Network&nbsp;from $30 million per fiscal year to$233 million for each of FY2026-FY2030, and$75 million for FY2031 and each fiscal year thereafter.Specific increases in funding are provided for the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and the National Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank.This section extends and increases funding for the Sheep Production &amp; Marketing Grant Program through FY2026. This program seeks to strengthen and enhance the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.This section also extends thePima Agriculture Cotton Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on cotton fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of cotton fabric;Agriculture Wool Apparel Manufacturers Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on wool fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of wool fabric;Wool Research and Promotion Program through FY2031, which provides grants to assist U.S. wool producers with improving the quality of wool and with developing and promoting the wool market; andEmergency Citrus Disease Research and Development Trust Fund through FY2031, which funds a program that aims to bring together scientists to find scientifically sound and financially sustainable solutions to&nbsp;Huanglongbing (i.e., citrus greening, a bacterial disease spread by an insect that feeds on citrus).&nbsp;TITLE II--COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICESThis title provides additional funding for, and modifies, various defense and national security projects and programs.(Sec. 20001) This section provides $7.5 billion in additional funding for FY2025 to the Department of Defense (DOD) for military personnel quality of life, which includes specified amounts forthe Marine Corps Barracks 2030 initiative,the Defense Health Program,supplemental payments of Basic Allowance for Housing to military personnel, andtuition assistance and child care assistance for members of the Armed Forces.The section also provides statutory authority to extend from 14 to 21 days eligibility for Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) for certain servicemembers undergoing a permanent change of station.Additionally, the section temporarily increases authorized investment amounts and provides additional authorization for the acquisition or construction of certain military housing through private contracts.(Sec. 20002) This section provides $29.2 billion in additional funding for FY2025 for the shipbuilding industrial base and various naval shipbuilding activities.&nbsp;(Sec. 20003) This section provides $24.4 billion in additional funding for FY2025 for the development of (1) space-based missile intercept capabilities, (2) military space-based sensors, and (3) the continued development of ground-based missile defense systems and related infrastructure.(Sec. 20004) This section provides $25.4 billion in additional funding for FY2025 for various military weapon systems, including hypersonic, air-to-air, cruise, and anti-ship missiles.This amount also&nbsp;includes&nbsp;additional funding for FY2025 for the Industrial Base Fund.(Sec. 20005) This section provides $16 billion in additional funding for FY2025 to expand the small, unmanned aerial system (UAS) industrial base, to advance the use of artificial intelligence in these and other systems, and to support the integration of commercial developments in military technology.This amount also includes additional funding to finance loans and loan guarantees by the DOD Office of Strategic Capital.(Sec. 20006) This section provides $380 million in&nbsp;additional funding for FY2025 to replace current business systems, deploy automation, and deploy artificial intelligence to accelerate audits of DOD financial statements.(Sec. 20007) This section provides $8.6 billion in additional funding for FY2025 to (1) modernize the capabilities of fighter, transport, and other military aircraft; (2) prevent the retirement of certain fighter aircraft (e.g., F-22); and (3) produce next-generation manned and unmanned aircraft.(Sec. 20008) This section provides $14.7 billion in additional funding for FY2025 for nuclear defense resources and nuclear forces development and production.&nbsp;This includes additional funding to expand the production capacity of the B-21 long-range bomber aircraft.This amount also&nbsp;includes additional funding for FY2025 for&nbsp;the National Nuclear Security Administration.(Sec. 20009) This section provides $12.7 billion in additional funding for FY2025 for (1) various military exercises and infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region, and (2) the development and procurement of military&nbsp;satellites.(Sec. 20010) This section provides $16.3 billion in additional funding for FY2025 to enhance and modernize (1) military depots and shipyards, (2) Special Operations Command (SOCOM) equipment, and (3) Air Force facilities.&nbsp;(Sec. 20011) This section provides $1 billion in additional funding for FY2025 to support border operations, including deployment of military personnel.(Sec. 20012) This section provides $10 million in additional funding for FY2025 for the DOD Office of Inspector General to monitor the activities for which funding is provided under this title.(Sec. 20013) This section authorizes each military department to use funding under this title for military construction, land acquisition, and military family housing. Each military department must submit a detailed spending plan to Congress.TITLE III--COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS(Sec. 30001) This section reduces funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).&nbsp;Specifically, the section reduces from 12% to 6.5% the cap on the percentage of combined earnings transferred from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board to the&nbsp;CFPB.(Sec. 30002) This section rescinds unobligated funds from the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program under the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The program provides funding for energy efficiency improvements in multifamily properties receiving HUD assistance.(Sec. 30003) This section closes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Reserve Fund and transfers the remaining amounts to the general fund of the Treasury. The fund, which pays for SEC expenses and is not subject to annual appropriation, was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and is funded by securities registration fees.(Sec. 30004) This section provides additional funding of $1 billion to carry out activities under the Defense Production Act of 1950. The act confers on the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in the interest of national defense, such as requiring industries to accept contracts for national defense purposes.&nbsp;TITLE IV--COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION(Sec. 40001) This section provides the Coast Guard with over $24.5 billion in additional funds for FY2025, to remain available through FY2029, to use expedited processes to (1) procure or acquire new operational assets and&nbsp;systems; (2) maintain existing assets and systems; (3) design, construct, plan, engineer, and improve necessary shore infrastructure; and (4) enhance operational resilience for monitoring, search and rescue, interdiction, hardening of maritime approaches, and navigational safety.This includes specified funds for various cutters and other programs. Cutters are Coast Guard vessels that are more than 65 feet long and have accommodations for a crew. (Those less than 65 feet long are called boats.)This title includes&nbsp;specified funds forfixed and rotary wing aircraft,long-range unmanned aircraft and base stations,Offshore Patrol Cutters,Fast Response Cutters,Polar Security Cutters,Arctic Security Cutters,light and medium&nbsp;icebreaking cutters,shore facilities, anddepot maintenance.(Sec. 40002) This section renews the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to auction licenses for the use of radio frequency spectrum and requires the FCC to auction at least 800 megahertz of spectrum within a specified time frame.Specifically, this section reauthorizes the FCC’s use of competitive bidding (i.e., auctions) to grant licenses for the use of specific frequencies through September 30, 2034. (The FCC’s auction authority must be renewed by Congress periodically. It expired on March 9, 2023, and has not been renewed.)&nbsp;However, the FCC is not authorized to auction certain frequencies used primarily by the Department of Defense.During this period of renewed auction authority, the FCC is required to auction at least 300 megahertz of spectrum, including at least 100 megahertz in specified frequencies (known as the Upper C-Band) within two years of this title’s enactment.Further, within four years of this title’s enactment, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) must identify 500 megahertz of additional&nbsp;spectrum currently allocated to the federal government for reallocation and auction.Specifically, the NTIA must select spectrum&nbsp;at frequencies between 1.3 and 10.5 gigahertz for reallocation to nonfederal use or shared federal use for full-power commercial licensed use cases (e.g., commercial mobile phone service). In selecting spectrum for reallocation, the NTIA must assess the feasibility of reallocating specific frequencies with the goal of maximizing auction proceeds.The FCC must auction the frequencies identified for reallocation within a specified time frame, and must complete auctions for the full 500 megahertz within eight years of this title’s enactment.&nbsp;If necessary to protect U.S. national security, the President must modify or withdraw any frequency identified for reallocation at least 60 days before an auction of that frequency.Finally, this section provides funding for the NTIA to conduct a timely spectrum analysis of certain frequency bands and to publish reports, biennially through 2034, on the value of all spectrum used by federal entities.(Sec. 40003) This section provides the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with $12.52 billion in&nbsp;additional funds for FY2025, to remain available through FY2029, for the acquisition, construction, sustainment, and improvement of facilities and equipment necessary to improve or maintain aviation safety.

Beginning in 2025, under this section, a taxpayer must provide a work-eligible Social Security number for themselves, for their spouse (if filing jointly), and for each qualifying child.(Sec. 70105) This section makes permanent the qualified business income (QBI) tax deduction, expands the phase-in range of the limitations on the QBI tax deduction to $75,000 for non-joint returns&nbsp;and $150,000 for joint filers (from $50,000 for non-joint returns and $100,000 for joint filers), and establishes a minimum QBI tax deduction of $400 for certain taxpayers.(Sec. 70106) This section increases the base estate tax, gift tax, and generation-skipping transfer tax exemption amount after 2025 to $15 million (from $5 million), adjusted for inflation.(Sec. 70107) This section makes permanent the increased alternative minimum tax exemption amounts and reduces the alternative minimum taxable income threshold amount to $500,000 ($1 million for joint filers) at which the exemption amounts begin to phase out (adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2026). (For 2025, the alternative minimum taxable income threshold amounts are $626,350 or $1,252,700 for joint filers, as adjusted for inflation.)Further, this section increases the percentage rate to 50% (from 25%) at which the alternative minimum tax exemption amount is phased out for individuals whose taxable income exceeds such threshold amount.(Sec. 70108) This section makes permanent the limit on the itemized tax deduction for home mortgage interest enacted in 2017 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Thus, under this section, taxpayers who itemize their tax deductions may deduct interest paid on the first $750,000 (or $375,000 for married individuals filing separately) of mortgage debt. As background, for tax years prior to 2018, an itemized tax deduction was allowed for interest paid on the first $1 million of mortgage debt&nbsp;(or the first $500,000 for married individuals filing separately).This section also allows certain mortgage insurance premiums to be included in the itemized tax deduction for home mortgage interest.(Sec. 70109) This section makes permanent a provision that limits the itemized tax deduction for unreimbursed personal casualty losses to such losses associated with a federally declared disaster. (As background, for tax years before 2018, the itemized tax deduction for unreimbursed personal casualty and theft losses was not restricted to such losses associated with a federally declared disaster.)However, this section also expands the itemized tax deduction to include unreimbursed personal casualty losses attributable to certain state declared disasters.(Sec. 70110) This section permanently eliminates the itemized tax deduction for most miscellaneous expenses.&nbsp;However, under this section, an itemized tax deduction for miscellaneous expenses is allowed for&nbsp;certain unreimbursed expenses incurred by teachers and other school personnel.

(Prior to 2018, employees could exclude reimbursements of up to $20 per month paid by an employer for qualified bicycle expenses as a qualified transportation fringe benefit. The exclusion from gross income for qualified bicycle expenses was temporarily eliminated for 2018-2025 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.)(Sec. 70113) This section permanently eliminates for most individuals the above-the-line tax deduction for moving expenses incurred to begin working in a new location. However, under this section, the tax deduction for moving expenses incurred to begin working in a new location is retained for certain active-duty members of the Armed Forces and expanded to include certain members of the intelligence community. (As background, prior to 2018, an above-the-line tax deduction was allowed for reasonable moving expenses incurred by an employee or self-employed individual to begin working in a new location if certain requirements are met. The tax deduction for reasonable moving expenses was eliminated through 2025, by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for individuals other than for certain members of the Armed Forces.)(Sec. 70114) This section makes permanent and further expands the limit on the itemized tax deduction for wagering losses.&nbsp;Specifically, under this section, wagering losses permanently includes expenses incurred in carrying on wagering transactions that would otherwise be deductible (e.g., travel to and from a casino). Thus, expenses incurred in carrying on wagering transactions may be deducted only to the extent that such expenses (in addition to any other wagering losses) are offset by gains from wagering that are included in gross income. &nbsp;&nbsp;This section further limits the tax deduction for wagering losses to 90% (from 100%) of the amount of wagering gains included in gross income. &nbsp;(Sec. 70115) This section permanently allows the designated beneficiary of an Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) account to make additional contributions to their ABLE account (subject to certain requirements and limitations) that are subject to an increased&nbsp;contribution limit.This section also increases the contribution limit to an ABLE account by adding one additional year to the annual adjustment for the cost of living.(Sec. 70116) This section permanently extends the qualified retirement savings contribution tax credit for contributions made to an ABLE account by the account’s designated beneficiary. Further, this section increases the maximum amount of the tax credit to $2,100 (from $2,000). &nbsp;(Sec. 70117) This section makes permanent the provision that allows nontaxable rollovers from a qualified tuition program (529 plan) to an ABLE account, subject to certain requirements.&nbsp;(Sec. 70118) This section permanently treats a qualified hazardous duty area as a combat zone for purposes of determining eligibility for certain federal tax benefits available to members of the Armed Forces. (As background, multiple federal tax benefits are available to members of the&nbsp;Armed Forces serving in a combat zone, including an exclusion from gross income of certain military pay, an extension of time to file income tax returns, and special estate tax rules.) &nbsp;This section also makes permanent the designation of the Sinai Peninsula as a hazardous duty area and expands such designation to include&nbsp;Kenya, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Chad.(Sec. 70119) This section extends the exclusion from gross income for the discharge of student loan debt due to the death or total and permanent disability of the student. However, under this section, the student must provide a work-eligible Social Security number to be eligible for the exclusion.(Sec. 70120) This section temporarily increases the limit on the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes (commonly known as the SALT deduction cap) and&nbsp;phases out the tax deduction for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income exceeding a certain threshold amount.Specifically, the SALT deduction cap increases in 2025 to $40,000 from $10,000 (or to $20,000 from $5,000 for married individuals filing separately). The SALT deduction cap increases in 2026 to $40,400 ( $20,200 for married individuals filing separately) and, then, by 1% each year after 2026, through 2029. In 2030, under this section, the SALT deduction cap reverts to $10,000 (or&nbsp;$5,000 for married individuals filing separately).Further, under this section, the amount of state and local taxes allowed as a federal tax deduction is reduced (but not below $10,000 or $5,000 for married individuals filing separately) by 30% of the amount that an individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold amount. The threshold amount in 2025 is $500,000 ( $250,000 for married individuals filing separately). The threshold amount increases in 2026 to $505,000 ($252,500 for married individuals filing separately) and, then, increases by 1% each year after 2026, through 2029.Chapter 2--Delivering on Presidential Priorities to Provide New Middle-Class Tax ReliefThis chapter establishes new tax deductions for qualified tips, qualified overtime, and some interest paid on a passenger vehicle loan. This chapter also establishes a new type of tax-advantaged account, called a Trump account.Below is a summary of the provisions in this chapter.(Sec. 70201) This section establishes a new above-the-line tax deduction, through 2028, of up to $25,000 for qualified tip income, which begins to phase out for individuals whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers). (Above-the-line deductions are subtracted from gross income to calculate adjusted gross income.)To be eligible for the tax deduction for qualified tip income, individuals must provide a work-eligible Social Security number for themselves and, if married, must file a joint federal tax return.(Sec. 70202) This section establishes a new above-the-line tax deduction, through 2028, of up to $12,500 ($25,000 for joint filers) for qualified overtime compensation, which begins to phase out for individuals whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).To be eligible for the tax deduction for qualified tip income, individuals must provide a work-eligible Social Security number for themselves and, if married, must file a joint federal tax return.(Sec. 70203) This section establishes a new tax deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on indebtedness incurred in 2025 through 2028 to buy a passenger vehicle (for personal use and subject to certain requirements). The tax deduction phases out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income that exceeds $100,000 (or $200,000 for joint filers).(Sec. 70204) This section establishes a new type of tax-advantaged account, called a Trump account, which is an individual retirement account (IRA) (but not a Roth IRA) for individuals under 18 years old. Up to $5,000 (adjusted for inflation) may be contributed to a Trump account in each year before the account beneficiary reaches the age of 18 years old. (Certain rollovers and qualified general contributions do not count towards the annual contribution limit.)Distributions from a Trump account may be made once the account beneficiary reaches the age of 18 years old. (Some exceptions apply.)This section also authorizes a one-time federal government deposit of $1,000 into a Trump account for individuals born after December 31, 2024 and before January 1, 2029 (subject to certain other requirements).Chapter 3--Establishing Certainty and Competitiveness for American Job CreatorsSubchapter A--Permanent U.S. Business Tax Reforms and Boosting Domestic InvestmentThis subchapter makes a number of changes to business-related federal tax provisions.Below is a summary of provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70301) This section permanently extends 100% bonus depreciation for property acquired and placed into service (and for certain plants planted or grafted) on or after January 19, 2025. (Bonus depreciation generally allows a business to deduct either the full cost or a large percentage of the cost of qualified property in the year that the property is placed into service, rather than depreciating such costs over a period of time.)(Sec. 70302) This section allows taxpayers to deduct domestic research and experimental expenses in the year such expenses are incurred (rather than requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenses over 5 years or, if elected, over 10 years). However, under this section, taxpayers must continue to capitalize and amortize over a 15-year period foreign research and experimental expenses.Under this section, taxpayers may elect to capitalize and amortize over at least 60 months domestic research and experimental expenses. (Some exclusions apply.)Further, under this section (1) small business taxpayers (with average annual gross receipts of $31 million or less) may claim a tax deduction for domestic research and experimental expenses retroactively to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, and (2) taxpayers may elect to accelerate amortization attributable to domestic research and experimental expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 2021 and before January 1, 2025.(Sec. 70303) This section reinstates the exclusion of the tax deduction for depreciation, amortization, or depletion from the calculation of adjusted taxable income for purposes of the limitation on the tax deduction for interest expenses for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.This section also expands the exclusion of interest on floor plan financing from the limit on the tax deduction for business interest expenses to include interest on floor plan financing of any camper or trailer designed to (1) provide temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, or seasonal use; and (2) be towed by, or affixed to, a motor vehicle.(Sec. 70304) This section makes permanent the business tax credit for paid family and medical leave and allows employers to base the tax credit on certain wages or premiums paid.Specifically, under this section, an eligible employer may claim a tax credit beginning in 2026, as part of the general business tax credit, for up to 25% of either (1) wages paid to qualifying employees during any period that such employees are on family and medical leave, or (2) the total amount of premiums paid or incurred for insurance policies that provide paid family and medical leave for employees. (As background, for 2018-2025, an eligible employer may claim a tax credit as part of the general business tax credit for up to 25% of wages paid to qualifying employees during any period that such employees are on family and medical leave.)(Sec. 70305) This section provides multiple exceptions to the limitation imposed on the tax deduction for employer-provided meals.&nbsp;Specifically, an employer generally may not deduct certain expenses paid or incurred after 2025 for (1) providing food or beverages to employees through an eating facility (operated by the employer for employees) that meets the de&nbsp;minimis requirements for fringe benefits (e.g., office snacks and coffee), or (2) meals provided by the employer for the convenience of the employer on the employer’s premises to employees and their spouses and dependents. (As background, de minimis fringe benefits are benefits that are so small as to make accounting for them unreasonable or impractical.)However, under this section, an employer may continue to deduct such expenses ifsold to customers (including employees) for adequate and full consideration,required to be provided under federal law by the employer to the crew of a commercial vessel,provided by the employer to the crew of a fishing vessel, orprovided to employees of certain fishing processing facilities in Alaska that are not located in a metropolitan area.(Sec. 70306) This section increases to $2.5 million (from $1.25 million in 2025 and adjusted annually for inflation) the maximum amount that may be deducted (expensed) for certain depreciable business assets. This section also increases to $4 million (from $3.13 million in 2025 and adjusted annually for inflation) the dollar amount at which the tax deduction begins to phase out. Both amounts continue to be annually adjusted for inflation.(Sec. 70307) This section provides for an elective 100% depreciation allowance for nonresidential real property that is placed into service before January 1, 2031, and that meets certain other requirements. (Some limitations apply.)(Sec. 70308) This section increases the advance manufacturing tax credit to 35% (from 25%) for property placed into service after December 31, 2025.(Sec. 70309) This section expands the exclusion from gross income for interest on certain bonds issued by state or local governments (specifically tax-exempt facility bonds) to include interest on bonds for which at least 95% of the net proceeds are used to finance a spaceport. (Thus, spaceports are treated in the same manner as airports for purposed of the federal tax-exempt facility bond rules.)Under this section, a spaceport is defined as any facility located at or in close proximity to a launch site or reentry site used formanufacturing, assembling, or repairing spacecraft, space cargo;flight control operations;providing launch services and reentry services; ortransferring crew, spaceflight participants, or space cargo to or from spacecraft.Further, this section provides that a tax-exempt facility bond is not considered federally guaranteed because an agency of the U.S. government is paying rent, fees, or charges for the use of the spaceport. (As background, state and local bonds that are federally guaranteed are not tax-exempt unless an exception applies.)Subchapter B--Permanent America-First International Tax ReformsPart I--Foreign Tax CreditThis part makes multiple changes to the foreign tax credit.Below is a summary of the provisions in this part.(Sec. 70311) This section limits the tax deductions a domestic corporate shareholder may allocate to net CFC tested income (formerly known as global intangible taxable income [GILTI] and renamed under Section 70323 of this act) for purposes of determining the limit on the foreign tax credit.&nbsp;(In this context, CFC refers to controlled foreign corporation.)Specifically, under this section, a domestic corporation may allocate to net CFC tested income (1) the tax deduction for 40% of the net CFC tested income amount included by such corporation in gross income and amounts treated as dividends attributable to such amounts, and (2) any other deduction directly allocable to such income.Further, under this section, interest expenses and research and development expenses paid by a domestic corporate shareholder may not be apportioned to net CFC tested income.(Sec. 70312) This section increases the tax credit allowed to a domestic corporation for income taxes paid by a controlled foreign corporation attributable to income included by the corporation as subpart F income and net CFC tested income (formerly known as GILTI and renamed under Section 70323 of this act).&nbsp;Under this section, for tax years beginning in 2026, a domestic corporation is allowed a foreign tax credit of up to 90% of the foreign income taxes that are paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation of which the domestic corporation is a shareholder and that are attributable to CFC tested income. (For tax years beginning before 2026, a domestic corporation generally is allowed a foreign tax credit of up to 80% of such foreign income taxes paid or accrued.)&nbsp;As background, the allowance of a tax credit for only a percentage of the foreign taxes paid or accrued on net CFC tested income is also known as the foreign tax credit haircut. Thus, under this section, the foreign tax credit haircut is decreased to 10% (from 20%).This section also applies the 10% foreign tax credit haircut to foreign income taxes paid or accrued on &nbsp;distributions of previously taxed net CFC tested income.(Sec. 70313) This section allows a percentage of the income from the sale of certain inventory to be treated as foreign-sourced income for purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit.Specifically, under this section, a U.S. person may treat as foreign-sourced income up to 50% of the income from the sale of inventory produced in the United States (for use outside of the United States) that is attributable to a foreign office or fixed place of business outside of the United States.&nbsp;Part II--Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income and Net&nbsp;CFC Tested IncomeThis part makes multiple changes to the tax deduction allowed to a domestic corporation for foreign-derived intangible income and GILTI.Below is a summary of the provisions in the part.(Sec. 70321) This section increases the tax deduction allowed to a domestic corporation for foreign-derived deduction eligible income (formerly known as foreign-derived intangible income and renamed under Section 70323 of this act)&nbsp;and net CFC tested income (formerly known as GILTI and renamed under Section 70323 of this act).Under this section, for tax years beginning in 2026, a domestic corporation generally may claim a tax deduction equal to the sum of (1) 33.34% of such corporation’s foreign-derived deduction eligible income, and (2) 40% of such corporation’s net CFC tested income.As background, for tax years beginning after 2017 and before 2026,&nbsp;a domestic corporation generally is allowed a tax deduction equal to the sum of (1) 37.5% of such corporation’s foreign-derived intangible income, and (2) 50% of such corporation’s GILTI. As enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and prior to modification by this section, the deduction decreased starting in 2026, to the sum of (1) 21.875% of such corporation’s foreign-derived intangible income, and (2) 37.5% of such corporation’s GILTI and amounts treated as dividends attributable to such amounts.(Sec. 70322) This section excludes gain from the sale or disposition of certain property&nbsp;from the calculation of the tax deduction for foreign-derived deduction eligible income.Specifically, under this section, deduction eligible income (for purposes of the tax deduction for foreign-derived deduction eligible income) may not include&nbsp;gain from the sale or other disposition (including the deemed sale or other disposition) occurring after June 16, 2025, of (1) property of a type that gives rise to rents or royalties, and (2) any other property that is subject to depreciation, amortization, or depletion by the seller of such property.Further, under this section, deduction&nbsp;eligible income must be reduced by expenses and deductions directly related to such income.(Sec. 70323) This section eliminates the use of a domestic corporation’s deemed tangible income return in determining foreign-derived intangible income and such corporation’s net deemed tangible income return in determining GILTI. As a result, under this section, the term foreign-derived intangible income is renamed foreign-derived deduction eligible income and the term GILTI is renamed net CFC tested income.Part III--Base Erosion Minimum TaxThis part makes changes to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT).Below is a summary of the provision in this part.(Sec. 70331) This section decreases the BEAT rate to 10.5% (from 12.5%) for tax years beginning after 2025. (Prior to amendment by this section, the BEAT rate wass 10% for 2025 and 12.5% for tax years after 2025.)Part IV--Business Interest LimitationThis part makes changes to the calculation of the limitation on the tax deduction of business interest expenses. Under current law, the tax deduction for business interest expenses is limited to the sum of (1) business interest income for the tax year in which the tax deduction is being claimed, (2) 30% of the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income, and (3) the taxpayer’s floor plan financing interest.Below is a summary of the provisions in this part.(Sec. 70341) This section provides that the&nbsp;limitation on tax deduction of business interest is calculated before capitalizable interest is calculated. (Some exceptions apply.)(Sec. 70342) This section excludes subpart F income and net CFC tested income (formerly known as GILTI and renamed under section 70323 of this act) from adjusted taxable income for purposes of calculating limitation on tax deduction of business interest.Part V--Other International Tax ReformsThis part makes permanent and modifies multiple federal tax provisions that impact foreign corporations.Below is a summary of the key provisions in this part.(Sec. 70351) This section permanently extends the CFC look-through rule. (Under the CFC look-through rule, certain interest expenses, dividends, rents, and royalties received by one CFC from a related CFC are not treated as foreign personal holding company income [for purposes of calculating subpart F income] if certain other requirements are met.)(Sec. 70352) This section requires a specified foreign corporation (generally a CFC or any foreign corporation with respect to which one or more domestic corporations is a U.S. shareholder) to use the taxable year of their majority U.S. shareholder , effective for tax years beginning after November 30, 2025. (For tax years beginning on or before November 30, 2025, a specified foreign corporation may elect a tax year beginning one month earlier than the majority U.S. shareholder.)Chapter 4--Investing in American Families, Communities, and Small BusinessesSubchapter A--Permanent Investments in Families and ChildrenThis subchapter makes multiple changes to federal tax provisions related to children and dependents.Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70401) This section increases the tax credit for employers that provide child care to their employees. Under this section, the portion of the tax credit for qualified child care expenses increases to 40% (from 25%) or to 50% for eligible small businesses. This section also increases the maximum amount of the tax credit to $500,000 (from $150,000) or $600,000 for eligible small businesses (adjusted for inflation).(Sec. 70402) This section makes up to $5,000 of the adoption tax credit refundable and adjusts this amount annually for inflation after 2025. However, under this section, the refundable portion of the adoption tax credit may not be carried forward. (Under current law, the amount of the allowed adoption tax credit that exceeds an individual’s tax liability may be carried forward for up to five years.)(Sec. 70403) This section allows Indian tribal governments to determine whether a child has special needs for purposes of calculating the adoption tax credit.(Sec. 70404) This section increases to $7,500 (or $3,750 for a married individual filing separately) from $5,000 (or $2,500 for a married person filing separately) the exclusion from gross income for amounts paid or incurred by an employer to an employee as part of a dependent care assistance program.(Sec. 70405) This section increases the non-refundable tax credit for expenses paid by an individual for the care of a child or dependent that enable such individual to be gainfully employed.&nbsp;Subchapter B--Permanent Investments in Students and Reforms to Tax-Exempt InstitutionsThis subchapter makes multiple changes to federal tax provisions related to education and certain educational institutions.Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70411) This section establishes a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $1,700 for cash contributions made by an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States to a tax-exempt organization that provides scholarships for qualified elementary and secondary school expenses to eligible students (scholarship granting organization), subject to limitations.(Sec. 70412) This section makes permanent the exclusion of education assistance paid by an employer to an employee (up to a maximum amount) from (1) gross income by an employee, and (2) wages by an employer (for employment tax purposes). Further, under this section, the maximum amount ($5,250 for 2025 and 2026) of employer-paid education assistance that may be excluded from gross income and wages is adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2027.(Sec. 70413) This section expands the expenses eligible for tax-free withdrawals from qualified tuition programs (529 plans) to include certain additional expenses related to enrollment or attendance at an&nbsp;elementary or secondary school.&nbsp;This section also increases to $20,000 (from $10,000) the limit on distributions from a 529 plan used in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary school.(Sec. 70414) This section expands the expenses eligible for tax-free withdrawals from 529 plans to include tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and other expenses related to the enrollment or attendance in a recognized postsecondary credentialing program.(Sec. 70415) This section replaces the excise tax of 1.4% imposed on the net investment income of certain private university and college endowments with a new rate structure of 1.4%, 4%, or 8%, depending on several variables including the value of the endowment and the number of full-time students who meet certain other requirements.(Sec. 70416) This section expands the excise tax imposed on certain tax-exempt organizations for excess compensation paid to certain employees (an employee who is one of the top five highest compensated employees of such organization) to include excess compensation paid to any employee of such organization. (Thus, a tax-exempt organization is liable for an excise equal to the corporate tax rate [21%] multiplied by the sum of remuneration in excess of $1 million and excess parachute payment paid to any employee by the tax-exempt organization.)Subchapter C--Permanent Investments in Community DevelopmentThis subchapter makes multiple changes to certain federal tax incentives related to investing in certain communities and tax deductions for charitable contributions.Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70421) This section permanently extends the Opportunity Zone program, establishes specific tax incentives for investments in rural areas, and modifies the rules related to deferred gains and stepped-up basis.As background, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act temporarily authorized tax incentives for investments (made through qualified opportunity funds) in designated economically distressed areas (called qualified opportunity zones). Specifically, qualified opportunity fund investors may (1) defer capital gain if such gain is reinvested in a qualified opportunity fund within 180 days, (2) exclude from gross income all (or part) of the capital gains from qualified opportunity fund investments held for a certain period of time, and (3) receive a step up in basis (value of the capital asset when it is sold) of 10% for qualified opportunity fund investments held for at least five years and an additional 5% for qualified opportunity fund investments held for at least seven years. (An increase in the basis of a capital asset generally lowers the taxable amount of such asset.)Under this section, capital gains from qualified opportunity fund investments made beginning in 2027, may be deferred to the earlier of the date on which such investment is sold or exchanged or five years after the date on which the investment is made. (Capital gain from qualified opportunity investments made before 2027, may be deferred to the earlier of the date on which such investment is sold or exchanged or December 31, 2026. (Thus, this section establishes a rolling five-year deferral for capital gains from qualified opportunity funds.)This section also eliminates the additional 5% step up in basis for qualified opportunity zone fund investments held for at least 7 years, but increases the basis for such investments held for at least 10 years to the fair market value of the investment.&nbsp;Finally, this section establishes qualified rural opportunity funds for investments in rural areas. Investors in qualified rural opportunity funds may be eligible for a 30% step up in basis if certain requirements are met.(Sec. 70422) This section increases eligibility for the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) by increasing the amount that a state may allocate for the LIHTC and reducing the tax-exempt bond financing threshold.As background, a taxpayer may claim the LIHTC for expenses incurred to rehabilitate or build rental housing for low-income tenants (1) if an allocation for the LIHTC is received from the state, or (2) a percentage of the project is financed by certain tax-exempt bonds. The amount a state may allocate for the LIHTC is calculated, in part, by multiplying a certain dollar amount (adjusted annually for inflation) by the state’s population.&nbsp;Under this section, beginning in 2026, the portion of the federal allocation to each state for the LIHTC that is based on the state’s population is increased by 12%.Further, this section lowers to 25% (from 50%) the tax-exempt bond threshold. Thus, under this section, if 25% or more of the aggregate basis (i.e., generally the costs) of the building and the land on which the building is located is financed with tax-exempt bonds, then the taxpayer is eligible for the LIHTC for the entire eligible basis of the project without a LIHTC allocation from the state. (If less than 25% of such basis is financed with tax-exempt bonds, then only the basis of the project that is financed with the tax-exempt bonds is eligible for the LIHTC.)(Sec. 70423) This section permanently extends the New Markets Tax Credit (a tax credit for certain investments in eligible, low-income communities).(Sec. 70424) This section makes permanent and increases to $1,000 for single filers (from $300) or $2,000 for joint filers (from $600 for joint filers) the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by individuals who do not itemize their federal income tax deductions.(Sec. 70425) This section imposes a new limitation on the itemized tax deduction for charitable contributions made by individuals beginning in 2026. Under this section, an itemized tax deduction for charitable contributions is allowed only to the extent that an individual’s aggregate charitable contributions exceed 0.5% of the individual’s contribution base (adjusted gross income calculated without including any net operating loss carryback amount). (This limitation is generally known as the 0.5% floor for the itemized tax deduction for individual charitable contributions and does not apply to tax deductions for charitable contributions made by individuals who do not itemize their tax deductions under Section 70424 of this act.)Further, under this section, the 0.5% floor also applies to excess charitable contributions made by individuals in 2026 or after that are carried forward to subsequent tax years. (Excess charitable contributions made prior to 2026 that are carried forward to subsequent tax year are not subject to the 0.5% floor.)&nbsp;(Sec. 70426) This section further limits the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation beginning in 2026. Under this section, a tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation is allowed only to the extent that the corporation’s aggregate charitable contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income. (This limitation is generally known as the 1% floor for the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation.)&nbsp;As a result of the 1% floor imposed by this section and existing limitations, a corporation may deduct charitable contributions only to the extent that such contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income but do not exceed 10% of the corporation’s taxable income (10% limit).Finally, under this section, special rules and limitations also apply to corporate charitable contributions carried forward to subsequent tax years.(Sec. 70427) This section reinstates and makes permanent (beginning in 2026) the $13.25 (currently $10.50) per proof gallon limit on the&nbsp;amount that is transferred by the United States to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for excise taxes collected on distilled spirits (e.g., rum) imported from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.As background, the United States imposes an excise tax of $13.50 per proof gallon on distilled spirits produced in or imported into the United States. A certain amount of the excise tax collected on distilled spirits imported from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are transferred back into the treasury of each possession. (This transfer is commonly known as the cover over or the rum cover over.) For 2022-2026, the rum cover over amount is limited to $10.50 per proof gallon. An additional rum cover over in the amount of $2.75 (for a total rum cover over of $13.25) authorized by Congress expired at the end of 2021.(Sec. 70428) This section treats participation or investment in fisheries (e.g., harvesting, processing, transportation, sales, and marketing of fish and fish products) in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands by certain tax-exempt Alaskan villages as substantially related to the village’s tax-exempt purpose and, thus, income gained from such activities remains tax-exempt.(Sec. 70429) This section increases to $50,000 (from $10,000) the limit on the tax deduction for &nbsp;expenses incurred by a whaling captain (as recognized by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission) in carrying out sanctioned bowhead whaling activities.(Sec. 70430) This section allows certain residential construction contracts entered into in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, to use another permissible method of accounting (e.g., the uniform capitalization rules), rather than the percentage&nbsp;of&nbsp;completion method of accounting. (The percentage of completion method of accounting or the percentage of completion-capitalized cost accounting method of accounting is used for residential construction contracts that are not home construction contracts and that are entered into in tax years beginning on or before July 4, 2025.)Subchapter D--Permanent Investments in Small Business and Rural AmericaThis subchapter modifies certain reporting requirements related to third-party settlement organizations and makes changes to several other federal tax provisions.Below is a summary of the key provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70432) This section modifies the reporting requirements applicable to third-party settlement organizations (e.g., certain online platforms, apps, and card payment processors). Under this section, such organizations are required to issue Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $20,000 from more than 200 separate transactions. (This section reverses a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that lowered the reporting threshold to $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions, the implementation of which was delayed and phased in by the IRS. For 2025, under current law, such organizations are required to issue IRS Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $2,500, regardless of the number of transactions.)(Sec. 70434) This section expands the federal tax deduction for certain film, television, and theatrical production costs to allow a deduction of up to $150,000 of qualified sound recording production costs in the tax year such costs are incurred. A qualified sound recording production is a sound recording that is produced and recorded in the United States. (Under current law, up to $20 million of film, television, and theatrical production costs incurred before 2026 may be deducted.)The section also extends bonus depreciation to qualified sound recording production costs.(Sec. 70436) This section eliminates the $200 excise tax imposed on the transfer of certain firearms other than machine guns and destructive devices&nbsp;(e.g., bombs, grenades, certain rockets, missiles, and mines). As a result, the $200 excise tax is not applicable to silencers, short-barreled rifles and short-barreled shotguns.Chapter 5--Ending Green New Deal Spending, Promoting America-First Energy and Other ReformsSubchapter A--Termination of Green New Deal SubsidiesThis subchapter terminates multiple energy-related federal tax credits.Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70501) This section terminates the previously-owned clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $4,000 for the purchase of a qualified previously-owned clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)(Sec. 70502) This section terminates the clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a qualified new clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)(Sec. 70503) This section terminates the qualified commercial clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, businesses may claim a tax credit of up to $40,000 for the purchase of a commercial clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)(Sec. 70504) This section terminates the alternative fuel refueling property tax credit. (Thus, a tax credit of up to $1,000 for individuals or up to $100,000 for businesses is allowed for the installation of property before July 1, 2026, that is used to store or dispense clean-burning fuel or to recharge electric vehicles.)(Sec. 70505) This section terminates the energy efficient home improvement tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $3,200, for certain energy-efficient property purchased and installed into a primary residence before&nbsp;2026.)(Sec. 70506) This section terminates the residential clean energy tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit for certain renewable energy equipment for a principal residence before&nbsp;2026.)(Sec. 70507) This section terminates the energy efficient commercial buildings tax deduction. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a deduction for certain energy efficient commercial property the construction of which begins before July 1, 2027.)(Sec. 70508) This section terminates the new energy efficient home tax credit. (Thus, contractors may claim a business tax credit for constructing an energy-efficient home that is acquired by a person for use as a residence before July 1, 2026.)(Sec. 70509) This section terminates the special five-year cost recovery period for investments in certain solar and wind property for which construction begins after December 31, 2024.&nbsp;As background, costs of property used in a trade or business to produce income generally are capitalized and then depreciated or amortized over a period of time (known as the cost recovery period). The cost recovery period for property used to produce electricity generally depends on the method for producing such electricity. However, for certain solar and wind property for which construction begins on or before December 31, 2024, the cost recovery period is five years. For solar and wind property for which construction begins after December 31, 2024, the general modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) and Internal Revenue Service guidance apply.(Sec. 70510) This section disallows the zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities). (The zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit generally is allowed for electricity produced at a qualified nuclear power facility and sold to an unrelated third person.)(Sec. 70511) This section terminates the clean hydrogen production tax credit in 2028 and, thus, the tax credit is allowed only for clean hydrogen production facilities for which construction begins before January 1, 2028. (As background, prior to changes made by this section, the tax credit is available for the production of clean hydrogen by a qualifying facility for which construction begins before 2033.)(Sec. 70512) This section terminates the clean electricity production tax credit for (1) wind and solar facilities placed into service after December 31, 2027, and (2) certain wind energy property or solar water heating property if such property is leased to a third party during the tax year. (As background, a tax credit is allowed, other than as provided by this section and subject to limitations, for clean electricity produced by a qualified facility. The tax credit is phased out beginning in the later of 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity are reduced to a certain level.) &nbsp;This section also disallows the clean electricity production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).&nbsp;Further, under this section, penalties may be imposed for (1) substantial misstatements of a certain amount related to the supply chain of manufactured products and product components for which the clean electricity production tax credit is claimed, and (2) overstating depreciable assets to claim the clean energy production tax credit. (Under this act, such penalties are also applicable to the clean electricity investment tax credit and the advanced manufacturing production tax credit.)(Sec. 70513) This section terminates the clean electricity investment credit for (1) wind and solar property, other than energy storage technology, placed into service after December 31, 2027; and (2) certain wind energy property, solar electric property, and solar water heating property if such property is leased to a third party during the tax year. (As background, a tax credit is allowed, other than as provided by this section and subject to limitations, for certain investments in energy storage technology &nbsp;or a facility that is used for generating electricity with an anticipated greenhouse gas admission rate of not greater than zero.)Under this section, the clean electricity production tax credit is not allowed for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).&nbsp;This section also sets the clean electricity production tax credit percentage to 30% (which may not be increased) for qualified fuel cell property for which construction begins after 2025. (As background, the clean electricity production tax credit is 6%, but may be increased to 30% if certain requirements are met, and further increased for property that is placed into service in certain locations, that meets certain construction requirements, or for which an allocation is received from the Clean Electricity Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Amount Program.)(Sec. 70514) This section terminates the advanced manufacturing production credit for wind energy components produced and sold after 2027, and for metallurgical coal (i.e., coking coal or coal used to manufacture steel) produced after 2029. This section also phases out the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for other critical minerals produced after 2030, as follows:75% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2031,50% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2032,24% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2033, and0% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2034.Under this section, the advanced manufacturing production tax credit is not allowed for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).(Sec. 70515) This section provides that the Department of the Treasury may not reallocate amounts that are (1) allocated for the qualified advanced energy projects tax credit, and (2) subsequently revoked. (As background, the Treasury may allocate up to $10 billion [in the form of a tax credit] to taxpayers for approved investments in certain advanced energy projects, subject to certain conditions and limitations. An allocation of the tax credit may be revoked if the project is not completed on time or certain other requirements are not met.)&nbsp;Subchapter B--Enhancement of America-First Energy PolicyThis subchapter modifies multiple energy-related federal tax provisions and makes changes to the calculation of the corporate alternative minimum tax.Below&nbsp;is a summary of the key provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70521) This section extends the clean fuel production tax credit through 2029 andrequires that clean fuels produced from feedstock use feedstock sourced from the Unites States, Canada, or Mexico;excludes emissions attributable to an indirect land use change from the calculation of lifecycle emissions estimates (used in part of the calculation of the clean fuel production tax credit); andrequires the Department of the Treasury to provide distinct emission rates for specific&nbsp;feedstocks used to produce clean fuels, including dairy manure, swine manure, and poultry manure.This section also disallows the clean fuel production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).(Sec. 70522) This section increases the carbon oxide sequestration tax credit to $17 (from $12) per metric ton for qualified carbon dioxide used (1) as a tertiary injectant in a qualified oil or gas natural recovery project and then securely stored or (2) by fixing such carbon dioxide through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, chemical conversion, or for some other commercial market purpose. (As a result, the same carbon oxide sequestration tax credit applies to carbon oxide captured and sequestered and carbon dioxide captured, used, and then sequestered.)This section also disallows the carbon oxide sequestration tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).(Sec. 70523) This section allows corporations to reduce their adjusted financial statement income (for purposes of calculating the corporate alternative minimum tax) to account for certain intangible costs related to oil, gas, or geothermal well drilling and development.(Sec. 70525) This section provides for a refund of previously imposed and paid excise taxes upon the transfer of nontaxable, indelibly dyed diesel fuel or kerosene used for agricultural, off-road, or other nontaxable purposes.Subchapter C--Other ReformsThis subchapter eliminates the de minimis exemption for certain imports into the United States and establishes a new civil penalty for using such exemption in a manner that violates U.S. customs laws.Below is a summary of the provision in this subchapter.(Sec. 70531) This section eliminates the exemption from certain duties, fees, and&nbsp;processes for imports of up to $800 (commonly referred to as the de minimis exemption), effective July 1, 2027.Further, this section establishes a civil penalty for entering, introducing, facilitating, or attempting to introduce an article into the United States using the de minimis exemption in a manner that violates U.S. customs laws. The amount of the civil penalty is up to $5,000 for the first violation and up to $10,000 for subsequent violations.Chapter 6--Enhancing Deduction and Income Tax Credit Guardrails, and Other ReformsThis chapter modifies various federal tax deductions and credits.Below is a summary of the key provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70604) This section establishes a 1% excise tax on transfers of payments from one country to another (also known as remittance transfers). The excise tax is imposed on the sender of the remittance transfer and collected and remitted to the Department of the Treasury (quarterly) by the transfer provider.&nbsp;Under this section, the excise tax applies only to remittance transfers for which the sender provides cash, a money order, a cashier’s check, or other similar physical instrument to the transfer provider. The excise tax does not apply to remittance transfers if (1) the funds are withdrawn from an account held at certain financial institutions, or (2) funded with a debit card or credit card issued in the United States.(Sec. 70606) This section requires an individual to provide a Social Security number to be eligible for the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits.(Sec. 70607) This section directs the Internal Revenue Service to deliver a report to Congress on tax filing programs. Specificallythe cost of enhancing and establishing public-private partnerships that provide for free tax filing for up to 70% of all taxpayers (calculated by adjusted gross income),the cost to replace any direct e-file programs run by the Internal Revenue Service,taxpayer opinions and preferences regarding a taxpayer-funded, government-run tax filing service or a free tax filing service provided by the private sector,assessment of the feasibility of providing simple and consistent options across participating tax filing providers, andthe cost of developing and running a free direct&nbsp;e-file tax return system..Subtitle B--HealthChapter 1--MedicaidSubchapter A--Reducing Fraud and Improving Enrollment Processes(Sec. 71101) This section delays until FY2035 implementation of certain provisions of the rule titled Streamlining Medicaid; Medicare Savings Program Eligibility Determination and Enrollment, which was issued by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) on September 21, 2023.&nbsp;Specifically, the section delays provisions of the rule that (1) specify that individuals who must pay a premium to enroll in Medicare hospital services, reside in a group payer state, and enroll during a general enrollment period may qualify for Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs) as early as the month of their entitlement to Medicare hospital services; (2) require states to use certain data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to facilitate the enrollment of qualifying individuals in both MSPs and the Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) program under the Medicare prescription drug benefit; and (3) align the definition of family size under MSPs with the definition under the LIS program.(MSPs allow individuals to receive Medicare cost-sharing and premium assistance from state Medicaid programs if they meet certain income and resource criteria. The LIS program, also known as the Extra Help program, provides similar assistance with respect to cost-sharing for covered drugs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit.)The section provides $1 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement this section and Sec. 71102 of this act.(Sec. 71102) This section delays until FY2035 implementation of certain provisions of the rule titled Medicaid Program; Streamlining the Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, and Basic Health Program Application, Eligibility Determination, Enrollment, and Renewal Processes, which was issued by the&nbsp;CMS on April 2, 2024.Specifically, the section delays provisions of the rule that, among other changes, (1) allow state Medicaid programs to verify an individual’s U.S. citizenship and identity through certain systems without additional proof of identity; (2) align certain Medicaid enrollment processes for those whose eligibility is not based on income with those that are based on income; and (3) establish additional timelines for Medicaid eligibility terminations, including when there is a change in an individual’s circumstances.(Sec. 71103) This section requires the CMS to establish a centralized system for states to check whether enrollees are simultaneously enrolled in Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in multiple states.&nbsp;Beginning no later than 2027, states must regularly obtain the addresses of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees from specified authorized sources. Beginning no later than FY2030, states must report on at least a monthly basis the Social Security numbers of enrollees to the CMS' newly established system. The CMS must notify states on at least a monthly basis of individuals who are enrolled in multiple states so that states may take appropriate action.The section provides $10 million for FY2026 and $20 million for FY2029 for the CMS to establish and maintain the new system, respectively.(Sec. 71104) This section requires state Medicaid programs to check, beginning in 2028, the SSA's Death Master File on at least a quarterly basis to determine whether Medicaid enrollees are deceased.(Sec. 71105) This section provides statutory authority for the requirement that state Medicaid programs check, as part of the provider enrollment and reenrollment process, whether providers are deceased through the SSA's Death Master File. Beginning in 2028, the section requires states to continue to check this database on at least a quarterly basis after providers are enrolled.(Sec. 71106) This section includes Medicaid payments to individuals for whom there is insufficient information as to their eligibility as erroneous excess payments that may ultimately reduce a state’s federal matching funds. These changes apply beginning in FY2030.(Sec. 71107) This section requires state Medicaid programs to redetermine every six months, beginning with the first quarter after December 31, 2026, the eligibility of individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (That act allows states to extend Medicaid coverage to all adults under the age of 65 with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, including able-bodied adults without dependent children.)The section provides $75 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71108) This section caps home equity limits for Medicaid nursing facility or other long-term care services beginning in 2028.Currently, in order to qualify for such services, an individual’s home equity may not exceed certain limits, as set by states in accordance with federal standards and adjusted annually for inflation. For 2025, home equity limits set by states must be between $730,000 and $1,097,000.The section caps the maximum home equity limit to $1 million, regardless of inflation. This limit does not apply to homes located on agricultural lots.(Sec. 71109) This section generally restricts, beginning in FY2027, federal payment for Medicaid and CHIP to services for individuals who are U.S. residents and are either U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban-Haitian entrants, or Compact of Free Association migrants lawfully residing in the United States. The restrictions do not apply to certain mandatory emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States or to optional services provided to certain lawfully residing children and pregnant women.Current law authorizes federal payment with respect to additional categories of individuals, including refugees; noncitizens granted parole for at least one year, asylum, or related relief; and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioners. The section excludes these individuals from eligibility.&nbsp;The section provides $15 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71110) This section reduces the Medicaid federal matching rate for emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States but who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population in states that have expanded Medicaid. Specifically, the section limits, beginning in FY2027, the Medicaid federal matching rate for emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States to the same matching rate as would otherwise apply for such services (rather than the enhanced federal matching rate for states that have expanded Medicaid).The section provides $1 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.Subchapter B--Preventing Wasteful Spending(Sec. 71111) This section delays until FY2035 implementation of certain provisions of the rule titled Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting, which was issued by the CMS on May 10, 2024.&nbsp;Specifically, the section delays provisions of the rule that, among other changes, (1) establish minimum staffing standards for nurses in Medicare and Medicaid long-term care facilities, including requiring a nurse to be onsite 24/7 and requiring a minimum of 3.48 total nurse staffing hours per resident per day; and (2) require state Medicaid programs to report on payments to direct care workers and support staff of nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.&nbsp;(Sec. 71112) This section shortens the window for retroactive Medicaid coverage. Specifically, the section specifies that, beginning with the first quarter after December 31, 2026, Medicaid coverage may begin retroactively (1) for individuals in the Medicaid expansion population, one month prior to the application filing date; and (2) for all other individuals, two months prior to the application filing date. Additionally, CHIP coverage may retroactively begin two months prior to the application filing date. (Currently, coverage may begin three months prior to the application filing date.)The section provides $10 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71113) This section prohibits federal Medicaid payment for one year to nonprofit health care providers that serve predominantly low-income, medically underserved individuals (i.e., essential community providers) if the provider (1) primarily furnishes family planning services, reproductive health, and related care; (2) offers abortions in cases other than that of rape, incest, or life-threatening conditions for the woman; and (3) in FY2023, received federal and state Medicaid payments totaling more than $800,000.The section provides $1 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.Subchapter C--Stopping Abusive Financing Practices(Sec. 71114) This section requires states that had not chosen to expand Medicaid pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act prior to March 11, 2021, to do so by January 1, 2026, in order to receive the corresponding enhanced federal matching rate.(Sec. 71115) This section generally limits Medicaid provider taxes beginning in FY2027.Under current law, states may impose a provider tax of up to 6% of net patient service revenues to potentially receive additional federal matching funds. The section precludes states that have not expanded Medicaid from increasing the rate of a provider tax beyond that currently in effect in order to qualify for federal matching funds. For states that have expanded Medicaid, a provider tax may not exceed the current rate or a specified rate, whichever is lower; the maximum rate gradually decreases from FY2028-FY2032, with a maximum rate of 3.5% beginning in FY2032 (these limits do not apply to nursing and intermediate care facilities, which are instead limited to current rates). The section additionally precludes states from imposing a new provider tax if there is not already one in effect.The section provides $20 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71116) This section provides $7 million per fiscal year for FY2026-FY2033 for the CMS to revise regulations so as to limit state-directed payments for inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, and qualified practitioner services at an academic medical center under Medicaid managed care contracts to the payment rate for services under Medicare, rather than the average commercial rate. For states that cover the Medicaid expansion population, payment is limited to 100% of the Medicare rate; for other states, payment is limited to 110% of the Medicare rate.Subchapter D--Increasing Personal Accountability(Sec. 71119) This section requires, beginning not later than the first quarter after December 31, 2026 (or earlier, at the option of the state), individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population to engage in community service, work, or other activities in order to qualify for Medicaid.Specifically, the section requires these individuals to, on a monthly basis, (1) work at least 80 hours, (2) complete at least 80 hours of community service, (3) participate in a work program for at least 80 hours, (4) be enrolled at least half-time in an educational program, or (5) engage in any combination thereof for a total of at least 80 hours. Individuals may also qualify if they have a monthly income (or, for seasonal workers, an average monthly income over six months) that is at least as much as the equivalent of minimum wage multiplied by 80 hours.Individuals who are applying for Medicaid must demonstrate compliance with these requirements for one to three months (as determined by the state) consecutively and immediately prior to filing an application; individuals who are already enrolled in Medicaid must demonstrate compliance for one month or more (as determined by the state), whether or not consecutive, during the period between the individual’s last eligibility determination and the next scheduled eligibility determination.&nbsp;States must verify an individual’s compliance upon a determination or redetermination of eligibility but may also choose to verify compliance more frequently. States may not waive the new requirements. However, states may choose to provide an exception for individuals experiencing short-term hardships (e.g., hospitalization).The section excludes certain individuals from these requirements, including those with serious medical conditions or with dependent children aged 13 or younger.&nbsp;Upon request, the CMS may exempt a state from fully implementing these requirements until December 31, 2028. States requesting an exemption must demonstrate good faith efforts to comply with the requirements and provide a detailed timeline for implementation.The section provides $200 million to states and $200 million to the CMS for FY2026 to implement these requirements.(Sec. 71120) This section requires, beginning in FY2029, states to institute cost-sharing requirements for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population and whose family income exceeds the federal poverty line. Cost sharing may not exceed $35 for an item or service; total cost sharing for all individuals in a family may not exceed 5% of the family’s income.&nbsp;The requirements do not apply to (1) services for which cost sharing is already prohibited (e.g., emergency services); (2) primary care, mental health, or substance use disorder services; or (3) services provided by federally qualified health centers, certified community behavioral health clinics, or rural health clinics. States may allow providers to condition the provision of services upon the payment of any required cost sharing.The section provides $15 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.Subchapter E--Expanding Access to Care(Sec. 71121) This section authorizes additional home and community-based services (HCBS) waivers (also known as Section 1915(c) waivers) for state Medicaid programs beginning on July 1, 2028. States may seek waivers to provide HCBS to individuals without the need for certain determinations as to whether an individual requires hospital or institutional care (as is required for current waivers). States must establish other needs-based criteria for such services.The section provides $50 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions. It also provides $100 million for FY2027 to support state HCBS programs.Chapter 2--MedicareSubchapter A--Strengthening Eligibility Requirements(Sec. 71201) This section generally restricts Medicare eligibility to U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban-Haitian entrants, and Compact of Free Association migrants lawfully residing in the United States. The SSA must identify Medicare enrollees who do not meet these requirements and terminate their enrollment within 18 months of this section’s enactment.Current law authorizes additional categories of individuals who are lawfully present in the United States to qualify for Medicare, including refugees; noncitizens granted parole for at least one year, asylum, or related relief; noncitizens with Temporary Protected Status; and noncitizens with deferred action, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. The section excludes these individuals from eligibility.(Sec. 71202) This section increases payments under the Medicare physician fee schedule for services furnished between January 1, 2026, and January 1, 2027.Subchapter B--Improving Services for Seniors(Sec. 71203) This section modifies certain provisions under the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program with respect to orphan drugs, including by excluding additional orphan drugs from qualifying for negotiation.The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program requires the CMS to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs under Medicare beginning in 2026. Among other requirements, drugs must have had market approval for at least 7 years (for drug products) or 11 years (for biologics) to qualify for negotiation. The program does not apply to orphan drugs that are approved to treat only one rare disease or condition.The section modifies these provisions so as to exclude any period in which a drug was an orphan drug from market approval calculations. It also excludes orphan drugs that are approved to treat more than one rare disease or condition from the program. The changes take effect in 2028.Chapter 3--Health TaxSubchapter A-- Improving Eligibility CriteriaThis subchapter modifies eligibility and verification requirements for the premium tax credit (which may be used to purchase health insurance on an exchange).Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 71301) This section limits a lawfully-present alien’s eligibility for the premium tax credit toan alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence;an alien who has been granted the status of Cuban and Haitian entrant; oran individual who is lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and&nbsp;Palau.(Sec. 71302) This section repeals the rule that allows certain lawfully-present aliens who have a household income of less than 100% of the federal poverty level and are ineligible for Medicaid (based on the individual’s alien status) to claim the premium tax credit.Subchapter B--Preventing Waste, Fraud, and AbuseThis subchapter requires verification of certain information supplied by individuals for purposes of determining eligibility for the premium tax credit, limits use of the premium tax credit, and expands recapture of excess advance payments of the premium tax credit.Below is a summary of the provisions of this subchapter.(Sec. 71303) This section requires the verification, beginning in 2028, of certain information for an individual to enroll in a health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange and to generally qualify for the premium tax credit. (Under current law, eligible individuals are allowed a premium tax credit, which applies toward the cost of obtaining health insurance through health insurance exchanges.)Specifically, under this section, a health insurance exchange must verify, using applicable enrollment information provided (or verified) by an individual,&nbsp;the following information:household income and family size,whether the individual is an eligible alien,any health coverage status or eligibility for coverage,place of residence, andany other information required by the Department of the Treasury.The verification requirements may be waived for individuals who enroll in a health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange during a special enrollment period due to a change in family size.(Sec. 71304) This section provides that the premium tax credit is not allowed for any health insurance plan enrolled in through a health insurance exchange during a special enrollment period provided by such exchange (1) on the basis of the relationship between the individual’s expected household income to the federal poverty level, and (2) not in connection with with the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances specified by the Department of Health and Human Services for such purposes.(Sec. 71305) This section eliminates the limit on the recapture of excess advance payments of the premium tax credit and, accordingly, allows the full amount of any such excess payments to be recaptured. (Under current law, individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level may be required to pay back only a portion of any excess advance payment of the premium tax credit.)Subchapter C--Enhancing Choice for PatientsThis subchapter expands health savings account (HSA) eligibility requirements.As background, individuals may establish and contribute to an HSA if they are covered under a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) and not covered under a health plan that (1) is not an HDHP and (2) provides coverage for any benefits that is covered under the HDHP (subject to certain exceptions).Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 71306) This section allows individuals to establish and make tax-deductible contributions to a health savings account (HSA) if covered by a health insurance plan that provides telehealth and other remote care services without requiring a deductible but otherwise meets the requirements of an HDHP.(Sec. 71307) This section expands eligibility to make tax-deductible HSA contributions to include individuals who have a bronze-level or catastrophic health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange.&nbsp;(A bronze-level health insurance plan provided through a health insurance exchange may or may not qualify as a HDHP, depending on the specific plan features. Catastrophic health plans provided through a health insurance exchange generally do not meet the requirements of a HDHP.)(Sec. 71308) This section expands eligibility to make tax-deductible HSA contributions to include individuals who have a direct primary care service arrangement with a fixed period fee that does not exceed $150 a month (or $300 a month if the arrangement covers more than one individual). The amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. (Some limitations apply.)Chapter 4--Protecting Rural Hospitals and Providers(Sec. 71401) This section provides $10 billion per fiscal year for FY2026-FY2030 for a program that supports the provision of health care in rural areas.&nbsp;Under the program, states may apply for financial allotments to improve the access and quality of care of services in rural areas, such as through enhanced technology, strategic partnerships, and workforce training. States must submit detailed rural health transformation plans and certify that no funds will be used to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid or CHIP. The CMS must approve or deny applications by December 31, 2025; states that receive approval do not need to reapply each year. States are not required to contribute any matching funds with respect to program allotments.The CMS must award allotments so that 50% of funds are awarded equally among all approved states. The remaining 50% of funds must be awarded based on certain considerations, including the proportion of rural health facilities in the state compared to the number of such facilities nationwide.The section additionally provides $200 million for FY2025 for the CMS to implement the program.&nbsp;Subtitle C--Increase in Debt Limit(Sec. 72001) This section increases the statutory debt limit by $5 trillion. (The debt limit is the amount of money that the Department of the Treasury may borrow to fund federal operations.)Subtitle D--Unemployment(Sec. 73001) This section prohibits payments under federal unemployment programs to individuals whose wages are $1 million or more. Such programs must include a method for individuals to certify that their income does not exceed this limit. State agencies that administer such programs must verify income information, to the extent possible, and provide for the recovery of any overpayments.&nbsp;TITLE VIII--COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONSThis title makes various changes to higher education, particularly to the federal student loan system.Subtitle A--Exemption of Certain Assets(Sec. 80001) This section exempts the assets of certain family farms, family-owned small businesses, and family-owned commercial fishing businesses from the information reported on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form.This exemption applies to the net worth of (1) a family farm on which the family resides, (2) a small business with not more than 100 full-time or full-time equivalent employees that is owned and controlled by the family, or (3) a commercial fishing business and related expenses (e.g., fishing vessels and permits) owned and controlled by the family.Prior to recent changes made to the FAFSA, the net worth of these family farms and family-owned small businesses were excluded as assets when calculating a student's financial need to determine federal student aid eligibility. Beginning with the 2024-2025 academic year, the net worth of these farms and businesses are treated as an asset and therefore included in the calculation. This section (1) restores the exemption to exclude the net worth of these family farms and family-owned small businesses from the calculation, and (2) expands the exemption to exclude the net worth of family-owned commercial fisheries from the calculation.Subtitle B--Loan LimitsThis subtitle makes various changes to federal student loans.&nbsp;(Sec. 81001)&nbsp;This section revises the types of federal student loans available to borrowers under the Direct Loan program and the borrowing limits for these loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The section terminates the ability of graduate or professional students to receive Direct PLUS Loans (i.e., Grad PLUS Loans) beginning on July 1, 2026.The section revises the annual and aggregate limits an individual may borrow in Direct Loans. In particular, the section establishes the aggregate loan limit for Direct Unsubsidized Loans as $100,000 for a graduate student (in addition to the amount borrowed for undergraduate education) and $200,000 for a professional student (in addition to the amount borrowed for undergraduate education).The section also places certain restrictions on Parent PLUS Loans beginning on July 1, 2026. In particular, the section sets an annual loan limit of $20,000 that may be borrowed on behalf of a dependent undergraduate student and a lifetime borrowing limit of $65,000 per dependent undergraduate student.The section also institutes new maximum aggregate limits for borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026. For example, the section sets an overall aggregate lifetime borrowing limit of $257,500 for any single borrower across federal loan types (except for Parent PLUS Loans).The section provides an exception to the loan limits described in this section (of up to three academic years) for a student who is already enrolled in a program of study and received a loan for the program.The section also&nbsp;requires that a student's loan amount for an academic year be prorated based on their enrollment intensity if the student is enrolled on a less-than-full-time basis.The section allows institutions of higher education (IHEs) to set lower loan limits&nbsp;if the limit is applied consistently to all students enrolled in the program.Subtitle C--Loan RepaymentThis subtitle revises loan repayment options for federal student loans.(Sec. 82001) This section terminates all current student loan repayment plans for new loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.The Department of Education (ED) may only offer borrowers two options for repayment of federal student loans: a standard repayment plan (with the length of the repayment term determined by the total amount borrowed) and an income-based repayment plan (to be known as the Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP). Consequently, borrowers with new loans made on or after July 1, 2026, are limited to these two repayment plans.Beginning on July 1, 2028, a borrower with a loan that is in a repayment status in accordance with, or an administrative forbearance associated with, an income-contingent repayment plan must begin repaying the loan under a new repayment plan. This applies to current borrowers who are on the following repayment plans: (1) the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, (2) the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plan, or (3) the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan. If a borrower does not select a plan, ED must enroll the borrower in either the RAP or the standard repayment plan.(Sec. 82002) This section eliminates economic hardship and unemployment deferments for borrowers who receive a federal student loan on or after July 1, 2027.

As background, the CEP allows eligible schools, groups of schools, and school districts the option to offer free breakfast and lunch to all enrolled students without collecting household applications.Specifically, USDA must establish a statewide CEP option that may be used by a state agency. The state agency must provide state (nonfederal) funding to local educational agencies to reimburse applicable schools at the free reimbursement rate for 100% of the meals served.Eligibility for the statewide CEP must be based on a statewide calculation of the percentage of identified enrolled students, regardless of a school's local educational agency. Further, the bill lowers the CEP participation threshold for a statewide CEP to an identified student percentage (ISP) of zero, from a minimum of 25% under current regulations.&nbsp;The ISP is the percentage of students who are eligible for free school meals without a household application, primarily those who are directly certified through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).In addition, the bill specifies that the reimbursement multiplier for school meals remains at the current level of 1.6. The reimbursement multiplier is used to calculate how many meals will be reimbursed at the free meal rate.

         "Broadband Expansion And Deployment Fee Equity and Efficiency Act of 2025 or the BEAD FEE Act of 2025This bill limits the nature of fees that states and territories receiving Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program funding may impose on applicants seeking authorization to construct or deploy broadband infrastructure.&nbsp;(The BEAD Program is administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and provides funding to eligible entities for broadband deployment, connectivity, mapping, and adoption projects. Eligible entities include U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia.)&nbsp;Under the bill, BEAD funds may not be provided to an eligible entity if the entity or a political subdivision of the entity charges fees (1) to consider a request to place, construct, or modify broadband infrastructure; or (2) for the use of a right-of-way owned or managed by the entity or a political subdivision, or for the use of infrastructure within such a right-of-way, to place, construct, or modify broadband infrastructure. However, this restriction does not apply to  fees that are competitively neutral, technology neutral, nondiscriminatory, publicly disclosed, and based on actual, direct, and objectively reasonable costs.  Any such fee must be described to applicants in a manner that distinguishes between (1) recurring and nonrecurring fees, and (2) the use of infrastructure on which there is no existing broadband infrastructure and the use of infrastructure on which there is existing broadband infrastructure as of the date of the application.&nbsp; Expanding Student Access to Mental Health Services ActThis bill authorizes state and local educational agencies to use Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants to improve mental health services available to students.

This resolution expresses support for the designation of National March into Literacy Month. This bill provides statutory authority for the application of certain technical and procedural standards to systems that transmit artificial or prerecorded telephone messages generated using artificial intelligence.Specifically, the standards require (1) that such messages clearly identify and state the telephone number or address of the individual or entity initiating the call, and (2) that any system making such phone calls release a recipient’s telephone line within five seconds of notification that the recipient has ended the call. Such standards are prescribed and implemented by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and apply under current law to any system used to transmit an artificial or prerecorded voice message by telephone.&nbsp;The bill also permits the FCC to apply the standards to other technologies used to transmit artificial and prerecorded telephone messages as it deems appropriate.&nbsp; American Science First Act This bill prohibits the National Science Foundation (NSF) from providing grants or other forms of assistance to certain foreign individuals and entities.

         "This bill reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by several congressional committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House or Senate Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRYThis title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).Subtitle A--Nutrition(Sec. 10101)&nbsp;This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.As background, USDA created the TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.(Sec. 10102)&nbsp;This section expands the applicability of work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs).As background, these SNAP recipients have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements. SNAP law limits benefits to ABAWDs to 3 months out of a 36-month period, unless the participant meets the additional work-related requirements.&nbsp;Specifically, the section amends the exemptions to this requirement.First, the section applies the work requirements for ABAWDs to adults who are not over 65 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.Second, the ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted to&nbsp;a dependent child under the age of 14. Currently, those with a child&nbsp;under the age of 18 are exempt from the requirements.This section includes an exception for individuals who are Indians, Urban Indians, or California Indians (as these terms are defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act).&nbsp;In addition, the section eliminates the current exemptions from the ABAWD work requirements for homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals (those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age).Finally, this section modifies the ABAWD waiver program's allowable state exemptions. Under current law, an ABAWD waiver program allows state exemptions based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs. The section allows Alaska and Hawaii to qualify for the state exemption with an unemployment rate that is at or above 1.5 times the national unemployment rate.&nbsp;Further, the section repeals the provision that allows a state exemption if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.(Sec. 10103)&nbsp;This section limits the availability of the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) for determining SNAP income eligibility. Specifically, only households that include an elderly or disabled member may be considered automatically eligible for the SUA based on participation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program.As background, when determining a household’s eligibility for SNAP, states consider the total shelter costs for a household, including the cost of utilities. States can use SUAs, which are standard amounts that represent low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Currently, all LIHEAP participants who receive a minimum benefit are eligible for the SUA for determining SNAP income eligibility.(Sec.10104) This section prohibits any service fee associated with an internet connection&nbsp; from being used in computing the excess shelter expense deduction for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits.(Sec. 10105) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments&nbsp;beginning in FY2028. The state contribution ranges from 0% to 15% for the cost of SNAP program allotments and is based on the state’s SNAP payment error rate. Currently, the state match is 0%.For FY2028, a state may elect either the FY2025 or FY2026 payment error rate to calculate its state-matching fund requirement. For FY2029 and each fiscal year thereafter, the state match is calculated using the payment error rate that is three fiscal years prior.Any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% will have a state match of 0% (i.e., the state does not have to contribute).A state with a payment error rate that isat least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 5%,at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 10%, and10% or greater must contribute 15%.(Sec. 10106) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs&nbsp;beginning in FY2027 and for each fiscal year thereafter. Currently, USDA must pay 50%&nbsp;of all administrative costs, thus this section increases&nbsp;the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.(Sec. 10107)&nbsp;This section eliminates&nbsp;funding for&nbsp;the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED).(Sec. 10108) This section limits SNAP benefits to individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals; (2) aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence as an immigrant, with exceptions; (3) aliens who have been granted the status of Cuban or Haitian entrant; or (4) individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.Currently, SNAP eligibility extends to additional individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law, including an alien who has qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws.Subtitle B-- Forestry(Sec. 10201) This section rescinds certain funds provided to the Forest Service as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. For example, this includes the rescission of funds for&nbsp;the protection of old-growth forests on National Forest System land,grants for nonfederal forest landowners for climate mitigation or forest resilience practices,grants for state and private forestry conservation programs for tree planting, andadministrative costs for the National Forest System to implement these and other related programs.Subtitle C--CommoditiesThis subtitle amends and extends commodity support programs.For example, the subtitle extends the Price Loss Coverage Program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, and Dairy Margin Coverage through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.(Sec. 10313) This section provides for a number of changes to Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), which includechanging the definition of production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;setting production history for the&nbsp;DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;raising the coverage limit to the first 6 million pounds for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first 5 million pounds; andallowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.Subtitle D--Disaster Assistance ProgramsThis subtitle expands the types of eligible losses covered under the permanently authorized agricultural disaster assistance programs, which include the Livestock Indemnity Program; the Livestock Forage Disaster Program; the&nbsp;Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program; and the&nbsp;Tree Assistance Program.

The SALT deduction cap increases in 2026 to $40,400 ( $20,200 for married individuals filing separately) and, then, by 1% each year after 2026, through 2029. In 2030, under this section, the SALT deduction cap reverts to $10,000 (or&nbsp;$5,000 for married individuals filing separately).Further, under this section, the amount of state and local taxes allowed as a federal tax deduction is reduced (but not below $10,000 or $5,000 for married individuals filing separately) by 30% of the amount that an individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold amount. The threshold amount in 2025 is $500,000 ( $250,000 for married individuals filing separately).

(Above-the-line deductions are subtracted from gross income to calculate adjusted gross income.)To be eligible for the tax deduction for qualified tip income, individuals must provide a work-eligible Social Security number for themselves and, if married, must file a joint federal tax return.(Sec. 70202) This section establishes a new above-the-line tax deduction, through 2028, of up to $12,500 ($25,000 for joint filers) for qualified overtime compensation, which begins to phase out for individuals whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).To be eligible for the tax deduction for qualified tip income, individuals must provide a work-eligible Social Security number for themselves and, if married, must file a joint federal tax return.(Sec. 70203) This section establishes a new tax deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on indebtedness incurred in 2025 through 2028 to buy a passenger vehicle (for personal use and subject to certain requirements). The tax deduction phases out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income that exceeds $100,000 (or $200,000 for joint filers).(Sec. 70204) This section establishes a new type of tax-advantaged account, called a Trump account, which is an individual retirement account (IRA) (but not a Roth IRA) for individuals under 18 years old. Up to $5,000 (adjusted for inflation) may be contributed to a Trump account in each year before the account beneficiary reaches the age of 18 years old. (Certain rollovers and qualified general contributions do not count towards the annual contribution limit.)Distributions from a Trump account may be made once the account beneficiary reaches the age of 18 years old. (Some exceptions apply.)This section also authorizes a one-time federal government deposit of $1,000 into a Trump account for individuals born after December 31, 2024 and before January 1, 2029 (subject to certain other requirements).Chapter 3--Establishing Certainty and Competitiveness for American Job CreatorsSubchapter A--Permanent U.S. Business Tax Reforms and Boosting Domestic InvestmentThis subchapter makes a number of changes to business-related federal tax provisions.Below are some examples of provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70301) This section permanently extends 100% bonus depreciation for property acquired and placed into service (and for certain plants planted or grafted) on or after January 19, 2025.&nbsp;(Sec. 70302) This section allows taxpayers to deduct domestic research and experimental expenses in the year such expenses are incurred (rather than requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenses over 5 years or, if elected, over 10 years). However, under this section, taxpayers must continue to capitalize and amortize over a 15-year period foreign research and experimental expenses.Under this section, taxpayers may elect to capitalize and amortize over at least 60 months domestic research and experimental expenses. (Some exclusions apply.)Further, under this section (1) small business taxpayers (with average annual gross receipts of $31 million or less) may claim a tax deduction for domestic research and experimental expenses retroactively to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, and (2) taxpayers may elect to accelerate amortization attributable to domestic research and experimental expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 2021 and before January 1, 2025.(Sec. 70303) This section reinstates the exclusion of the tax deduction for depreciation, amortization, or depletion from the calculation of adjusted taxable income for purposes of the limitation on the tax deduction for interest expenses for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.This section also expands the exclusion of interest on floor plan financing from the limit on the tax deduction for business interest expenses to include interest on floor plan financing of any camper or trailer designed to (1) provide temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, or seasonal use; and (2) be towed by, or affixed to, a motor vehicle.(Sec. 70306) This section increases to $2.5 million (from $1.25 million in 2025 and adjusted annually for inflation) the maximum amount that may be deducted (expensed) for certain depreciable business assets.

(Some limitations apply.)(Sec. 70308) This section increases the advance manufacturing tax credit to 35% (from 25%) for property placed into service after December 31, 2025.Subchapter B--Permanent America-First International Tax ReformsPart I--Foreign Tax CreditThis part makes multiple changes to the foreign tax credit.Below is an example from one provision in this part.(Sec. 70311) This section limits the tax deductions a domestic corporate shareholder may allocate to income in the global intangible taxable income (GILTI) category for purposes of determining limit on the foreign tax credit to (1) the tax deduction for 40% of the GILTI amount included by such corporation in gross income and amounts treated as dividends attributable to such amounts and (2) any other deduction directly allocable to such income.Part II--Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income and Net CFC Tested IncomeThis part makes multiple changes to the tax deduction allowed to a domestic corporation for foreign-derived intangible income and GILTI.Below is a summary of the provisions in the part.(Sec. 70321) This section increases the tax deduction allowed to a domestic corporation for foreign-derived intangible income and GILTI to the sum of (1) 33.34% such corporation’s foreign-derived intangible income, and (2) 40% of such corporation’s GILTI and amounts treated as dividends attributable to such amounts.Under current law, a domestic corporation is allowed a tax deduction equal to the sum of (1) 37.5% (or 21.875% for tax years beginning in 2026) of such corporation’s foreign-derived intangible income, and (2) 50% (or 37.5% for tax years beginning in 2026) of such corporation’s GILTI and amounts treated as dividends attributable to such amounts. (Some limitations apply.)(Sec. 70322) This section excludes from deduction-eligible income for purposes of calculating foreign-derived intangible income (and the tax deduction for such income) income or gain from the sale or other disposition (including the deemed sale or other disposition) occurring after June 16, 2025, of (1) property of a type that gives rise to rents or royalties, and (2) any other property that is subject to depreciation, amortization, or depletion by the seller of such property.Further, under this section, deduction-eligible income must be reduced by expenses and deductions directly related to such income.(Sec. 70323) This section eliminates the use of a domestic corporation’s deemed tangible income return in determining foreign-derived intangible income and such corporation’s net deemed tangible income return in determining GILTI. As a result, under this section, the term foreign-derived intangible income is renamed foreign-derived deduction eligible income and the term GILTI is renamed net CFC tested income. (In this context, CFC refers to controlled foreign corporation.)Part III--Base Erosion Minimum TaxThis part makes changes to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT).Below is a summary of the provision in this part.(Sec. 70331) This section decreases the BEAT rate to 10.5% (from 12.5%) for tax years beginning after 2025. (Under current law, the BEAT rate is 10% for 2025 and 12.5% for tax years after 2025.)Part IV--Business Interest LimitationThis part makes changes to the calculation of the limitation on the tax deduction of business interest expenses.

(Under current law, a specified foreign corporation may elect a tax year beginning one month earlier than the majority U.S. shareholder.)Chapter 4--Investing in American Families, Communities, and Small BusinessesSubchapter A--Permanent Investments in Families and ChildrenThis subchapter makes multiple changes to federal tax provisions related to children and dependents.Below are some examples of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70401) This section increases the tax credit for employers that provide child care to their employees. Under this section, the portion of the tax credit for qualified child care expenses increases to 40% (from 25%) or to 50% for eligible small businesses. This section also increases the maximum amount of the tax credit to $500,000 (from $150,000) or $600,000 for eligible small businesses (adjusted for inflation).(Sec. 70404) This section increases to $7,500 or $3,750 for a married individual filing separately (from $5,000 or $2,500 for a married person filing separately) the exclusion from gross income for amounts paid or incurred by an employer to an employee as part of a dependent care assistance program.(Sec. 70405) This section increases the non-refundable tax credit for expenses paid by an individual for the care of a child or dependent that enable such individual to be gainfully employed.&nbsp;Subchapter B--Permanent Investments in Students and Reforms to Tax-Exempt InstitutionsThis subchapter makes multiple changes to federal tax provisions related to education and certain educational institutions.Below are some examples of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70411) This section establishes a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $1,700 for cash contributions made by an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States to a tax-exempt organization that provides scholarships for qualified elementary and secondary school expenses to eligible students (scholarship granting organization), subject to limitations.(Sec. 70413) This section expands the expenses eligible for tax-free withdrawals from qualified tuition programs (529 plans) to include certain additional expenses related to enrollment or attendance at an&nbsp;elementary or secondary school.This section also increases to $20,000 (from $10,000) the limit on distributions from a 529 plan used in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary school.(Sec. 70414) This section expands the expenses eligible for tax-free withdrawals from 529 plans to include tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and other expenses related to the enrollment or attendance in a recognized postsecondary credentialing program.(Sec. 70415) This section replaces the excise tax of 1.4% imposed on the net investment income of certain private university and college endowments with a new rate structure of 1.4%, 4%, or 8%, depending on several variables including the value of the endowment and the number of full-time students who meet certain other requirements.Subchapter C--Permanent Investments in Community DevelopmentThis subchapter makes multiple changes to certain federal tax incentives related to investing in certain communities and tax deductions for charitable contributions.Below are examples from this subchapter.(Sec. 70423) This section permanently extends the New Markets Tax Credit (a tax credit for certain investments in eligible, low-income communities).(Sec. 70424) This section makes permanent and increases to $1,000 for single filers (from $300) or $2,000 for joint filers (from $600 for joint filers) the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by individuals who do not itemize their federal income tax deductions.Subchapter D--Permanent Investments in Small Business and Rural AmericaThis subchapter modifies certain reporting requirements related to third-party settlement organizations and makes changes to several other federal tax provisions.Below are some examples of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70432) This section modifies the reporting requirements applicable to third-party settlement organizations (e.g., certain online platforms, apps, and card payment processors). Under this section, such organizations are required to issue Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $20,000 from more than 200 separate transactions. (This section reverses a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that lowered the reporting threshold to $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions, the implementation of which was delayed and phased in by the IRS. For 2025, under current law, such organizations are required to issue IRS Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $2,500, regardless of the number of transactions.)(Sec. 70434) This section expands the federal tax deduction for certain film, television, and theatrical production costs to allow a deduction of up to $150,000 of qualified sound recording production costs in the tax year such costs are incurred. A qualified sound recording production is a sound recording that is produced and recorded in the United States. (Under current law, up to $20 million of film, television, and theatrical production costs incurred before 2026 may be deducted.)The section also extends bonus depreciation to qualified sound recording production costs.(Under current law, taxpayers may claim a bonus depreciation allowance of between 20% to 100% of the cost of qualified property depending on when such property is placed into service. Section 70301 of the bill extends 100% bonus depreciation through 2029 [or 2030 for some types of property].)(Sec. 70436) This section eliminates the $200 excise tax imposed on the transfer of certain firearms other than machine guns and destructive devices.

Beginning no later than FY2030, states must report on at least a monthly basis the Social Security numbers of enrollees to the CMS' newly established system. The CMS must notify states on at least a monthly basis of individuals who are enrolled in multiple states so that states may take appropriate action.The section provides funds for FY2026 and FY2029 for the CMS to establish and maintain the new system, respectively.(Sec. 71104) This section requires state Medicaid programs to check, beginning in 2028, the Social Security Administration's Death Master File on at least a quarterly basis to determine whether Medicaid enrollees are deceased.(Sec. 71105) This section provides statutory authority for the requirement that state Medicaid programs check, as part of the provider enrollment and reenrollment process, whether providers are deceased through the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.&nbsp;Beginning in 2028, the section requires states to continue to check this database on at least a quarterly basis after providers are enrolled.(Sec. 71107) This section requires state Medicaid programs to redetermine every six months, beginning with the first quarter after December 31, 2026, the eligibility of individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (The act allows states to extend Medicaid coverage to all adults under the age of 65 with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, including able-bodied adults without dependent children.)The section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71109) This section generally restricts, beginning in FY2027, federal payment for Medicaid and CHIP to services for individuals who are U.S. residents and are either U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban-Haitian entrants, or Compact of Free Association migrants lawfully residing in the United States.The section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71110) This section limits, beginning in FY2027, the Medicaid federal matching rate for emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States to the same matching rate as would otherwise apply for such services (rather than the enhanced federal matching rate for states that have expanded Medicaid).The section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.Subchapter B--Preventing Wasteful Spending(Sec. 71112) This section specifies that, beginning with the first quarter after December 31, 2026, Medicaid coverage may begin retroactively (1) for individuals in the Medicaid expansion population, one month prior to the application filing date; and (2) for all other individuals, two months prior to the application filing date.

The section precludes states that have not expanded Medicaid from increasing the rate of a provider tax beyond that currently in effect in order to qualify for federal matching funds. For states that have expanded Medicaid, a provider tax may not exceed the current rate or a specified rate, whichever is lower; the maximum rate gradually decreases from FY2028-FY2032, with a maximum rate of 3.5% beginning in FY2032 (these limits do not apply to nursing and intermediate care facilities, which are instead limited to current rates). The section additionally precludes states from imposing a new provider tax if there is not already one in effect.The section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71116) This section provides funds through FY2033 for the CMS to revise regulations so as to limit state-directed payments for inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, or qualified practitioner services at an academic medical center under Medicaid managed care contracts to the payment rate for services under Medicare, rather than the average commercial rate. For states that cover the Medicaid expansion population, payment is limited to 100% of the Medicare rate; for other states, payment is limited to 110% of the Medicare rate.Subchapter D--Increasing Personal Accountability(Sec. 71119) This section requires, beginning not later than the first quarter after December 31, 2026 (or earlier, at the option of the state), individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population to engage in community service, work, or other activities in order to qualify for Medicaid.Specifically, the section requires these individuals to, on a monthly basis, (1) work at least 80 hours, (2) complete at least 80 hours of community service, (3) participate in a work program for at least 80 hours, (4) be enrolled at least half-time in an educational program, or (5) engage in any combination thereof for a total of at least 80 hours. Individuals may also qualify if they have a monthly income (or, for seasonal workers, an average monthly income over six months) that is at least as much as the equivalent of minimum wage multiplied by 80 hours.Individuals who are applying for Medicaid must demonstrate compliance with these requirements for one to three months (as determined by the state) consecutively and immediately prior to filing an application; individuals who are already enrolled in Medicaid must demonstrate compliance for one month or more (as determined by the state), whether or not consecutive, during the period between the individual’s last eligibility determination and the next scheduled eligibility determination.&nbsp;States must verify an individual’s compliance upon a determination or redetermination of eligibility but may also choose to verify compliance more frequently. States may not waive the new requirements. However, states may choose to provide an exception for individuals experiencing short-term hardships (e.g., hospitalization).The section excludes certain individuals from these requirements, including those with serious medical conditions or dependent children aged 13 or younger.&nbsp;Upon request, the CMS may exempt a state from fully implementing these requirements until December 31, 2028. States requesting an exemption must demonstrate good faith efforts to comply with the requirements and provide a detailed timeline for implementation.The section provides funds for FY2026 for states and the CMS to implement these requirements.(Sec. 71120) This section requires, beginning in FY2029, states to institute cost-sharing requirements for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population and whose family income exceeds the federal poverty line. Cost sharing may not exceed $35 for an item or service; total cost sharing for all individuals in a family may not exceed 5% of the family’s income.&nbsp;The requirements do not apply to (1) services for which cost sharing is already prohibited (e.g., emergency services); (2) primary care, mental health, or substance use disorder services; or (3) services provided by federally qualified health centers, certified community behavioral health clinics, or rural health clinics. States may allow providers to condition the provision of services upon the payment of any required cost sharing.The section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.Subchapter E--Expanding Access to Care(Sec. 71121) This section authorizes additional home and community-based services (HCBS) waivers (also known as Section 1915(c) waivers) for state Medicaid programs beginning on July 1, 2028. States may seek waivers to provide HCBS to individuals without the need for certain determinations as to whether an individual requires hospital or institutional care (as is required for current waivers). States must establish other needs-based criteria for such services.The section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions. It also provides funds for FY2027 to support state HCBS programs.Chapter 2--MedicareSubchapter A--Strengthening Eligibility Requirements(Sec. 71201) This section generally restricts Medicare eligibility to U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban-Haitian entrants, and Compact of Free Association migrants lawfully residing in the United States. The Social Security Administration must identify Medicare enrollees who do not meet these requirements and terminate their enrollment within 18 months of this section’s enactment.Subchapter B--Improving Services for Seniors(Sec. 71203) This section modifies certain provisions under the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program with respect to orphan drugs.The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program requires the CMS to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs under Medicare beginning in 2026. Among other requirements, drugs must have had market approval for at least 7 years (for drug products) or 11 years (for biologics) to qualify for negotiation. The program does not apply to orphan drugs that are approved to treat only one rare disease or condition.The section modifies these provisions so as to exclude any period in which a drug was an orphan drug from market approval calculations. It also excludes orphan drugs that are approved to treat more than one rare disease or condition from the program. The changes take effect in 2028.Chapter 3--Health TaxSubchapter A-- Improving Eligibility CriteriaThis subchapter modifies eligibility and verification requirements for the premium tax credit (which may be used to purchase health insurance on an exchange).Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 71301) This section limits a lawfully-present alien’s eligibility for the premium tax credit toan alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence;an alien who has been granted the status of Cuban and Haitian entrant; oran individual who is lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.(Sec. 71302) This section repeals the rule that allows certain lawfully-present aliens who have a household income of less than 100% of the federal poverty level and are ineligible for Medicaid (based on the individual’s alien status) to claim the premium tax credit.Subchapter B--Preventing Waste, Fraud, and AbuseThis subchapter requires verification of certain information supplied by individuals for purposes of determining eligibility for the premium tax credit, limits use of the premium tax credit, and expands recapture of excess advance payments of the premium tax credit.Below is a summary of the provisions of this subchapter.(Sec. 71303) This section requires the verification of certain information for an individual to enroll in a health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange and to generally qualify for the premium tax credit. (Under current law, eligible individuals are allowed a premium tax credit, which applies toward the cost of obtaining health insurance through health insurance exchanges.)Specifically, under this section, the following information must be verifiedhousehold income and family size,whether the individual is an eligible alien,any health coverage status or eligibility for coverage,place of residence, andany other information required by the Department of the Treasury.(Sec. 71304) This section provides that the premium tax credit is not allowed for any health insurance plan enrolled in through a health insurance exchange during a special enrollment period provided by such exchange (1) on the basis of the relationship between the individual’s expected household income to the federal poverty level and (2) not in connection with&nbsp;with the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances specified by the Department of Health and Human Services for such purposes.(Sec. 71305) This section eliminates the limit on the recapture of excess advance payments of the premium tax credit and, accordingly, allows the full amount of any such excess payments to be recaptured. (Under current law, individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level may be required to pay back only a portion of any excess advance payment of the premium tax credit.)Subchapter C--Enhancing Choice for PatientsThis subchapter expands health savings account (HSA) eligibility requirements.Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 71306) This section allows individuals to establish and make tax-deductible contributions to a health savings account (HSA) if covered by a health insurance plan that provides telehealth and other remote care services without requiring a deductible but otherwise meets the requirements of a high-deductible health plan (HDHP).(Sec. 71307) This section expands eligibility to make tax-deductible HSA contributions to include individuals who have a bronze-level or catastrophic health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange.(Sec. 71308) This section expands eligibility to make tax-deductible HSA contributions to include individuals who have a direct primary care service arrangement with a fixed period fee that does not exceed $150 a month (or $300 a month if the arrangement covers more than one individual). The amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. (Some limitations apply.)Chapter 4--Protecting Rural Hospitals and Providers(Sec. 71401) This section provides funds through FY2030 for a program that supports the provision of health care in rural areas. Under the program, states may apply for financial allotments to improve the access and quality of care of services in rural areas, such as through enhanced technology, strategic partnerships, and workforce training.&nbsp;Subtitle C--Increase in Debt Limit(Sec. 72001) This section increases the statutory debt limit by $5 trillion. (The debt limit is the amount of money that the Department of the Treasury may borrow to fund federal operations.)Subtitle D--Unemployment(Sec. 73001) This section prohibits payments under federal unemployment programs to individuals whose wages are $1 million or more. Such programs must include a method for individuals to certify that their income does not exceed this limit. State agencies that administer such programs must verify income information, to the extent possible, and provide for the recovery of any overpayments. &nbsp;TITLE VIII--COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONSThis title makes various changes to higher education, particularly to the federal student loan system.Subtitle A--Exemption of Certain Assets(Sec. 80001) This section includes an exemption for certain family farms, small businesses, and commercial fishing businesses&nbsp;on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. This exemption applies to the net worth of (1) a family farm on which the family resides, (2) a small business with not more than 100 full-time or full-time equivalent employees that is owned and controlled by the family, or (3) a commercial fishing business and related expenses (e.g., fishing vessels and permits) owned and controlled by the family.Subtitle B--Loan LimitsThis subtitle makes various changes to federal student loans.&nbsp;(Sec. 81001) This section terminates the ability of graduate or professional students to receive Direct PLUS Loans (i.e., Grad PLUS Loans) beginning on July 1, 2026.The section sets&nbsp;annual and aggregate borrowing limits for graduate and professional students. In particular, the section establishes the aggregate loan limit for Direct Unsubsidized Loans as $100,000 for a graduate student (in addition to the amount borrowed for undergraduate education) and $200,000 for a professional student (in addition to the amount borrowed for undergraduate education).The section also places certain restrictions on Parent PLUS Loans beginning on July 1, 2026. In particular, the section sets an annual loan limit of $20,000 that may be borrowed on behalf of a dependent student and a lifetime borrowing limit of $65,000 per dependent student.The section also establishes new annual and aggregate loan limits for borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026. For example, the section sets an overall aggregate lifetime borrowing limit of $257,500 for any single borrower across federal loan types (except for Federal Direct PLUS Loans and Parent PLUS Loans).The section provides an exception to the loan limits described in this section (of up to three academic years) for a student who is already enrolled in a program of study and received a loan for the program.The section allows institutions of higher education (IHEs) to set lower loan limits.Subtitle C--Loan RepaymentThis subtitle revises loan repayment options for federal student loans.(Sec. 82001) This section terminates all current student loan repayment plans for new loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.The Department of Education (ED) may only offer borrowers two options for repayment of federal student loans: a standard repayment plan (with the length of the repayment term determined by the total amount borrowed) and an income-based repayment plan (to be known as the Repayment Assistance Plan).The section includes a transition to income-based repayment plans. Beginning on July 1, 2028, a borrower with a loan that is in a repayment status in accordance with, or an administrative forbearance associated with, an income-contingent repayment plan (e.g., current borrowers on the&nbsp;Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan) must begin repaying the loan under a new repayment plan. If a borrower does not select a plan, ED must enroll the borrower in either the Repayment Assistance Plan or the standard repayment plan.(Sec. 82002) This section eliminates economic hardship and unemployment deferments beginning on July 1, 2027. It also reduces the total period a borrower may be in forbearance.(Sec. 82003) This section allows borrowers to rehabilitate a defaulted loan twice (currently, only once). However, beginning on July 1, 2027, the borrower must pay a minimum payment amount of $10.(Sec. 82004) This section allows payments under the new Repayment Assistance Plan to count as qualifying payments for purposes of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.(Sec. 82005) This section provides&nbsp;funding to ED for administrative costs, including for the costs of student loan servicing.Subtitle D--Pell GrantsThis subtitle makes changes to Pell Grants.(Sec. 83001) This section requires foreign income that is exempt from taxation or foreign income for which an individual receives a foreign tax credit to be included in the adjusted gross income calculation for purposes of calculating eligibility for Pell Grants.Students with a student aid index that equals or exceeds twice the amount of the total maximum Pell Grant are ineligible for Pell Grants, regardless of their adjusted gross income.&nbsp;The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.(Sec. 83002) This section requires ED to award Workforce Pell Grants to students enrolled in eligible workforce programs. Eligible programs are those that provide at least 150 clock hours (but less than 600 clock hours) of instruction during a minimum of 8 weeks (but less than 15 weeks).The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.(Sec. 83003) This section increases funding for Pell Grants for FY2026.(Sec. 83004) This section makes a student ineligible for Pell Grants if the student receives grant aid from nonfederal sources (e.g., states, IHEs, or private sources) in an amount that equals or exceeds the student's cost of attendance.The&nbsp;section's changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.Subtitle E--Accountability(Sec. 84001) This section requires IHEs participating in federal student loan programs to meet cohort median earning requirements.&nbsp;Specifically, the section prohibits an IHE from using federal funds for student enrollment in low-earning outcome programs.&nbsp;Low-earning outcome programs are educational programs in which the graduating cohorts earn less as working adults compared to those with lesser degrees (e.g., a high school diploma instead of a bachelor's degree).If an educational program does not meet the cohort median earning requirements, the IHE must promptly notify each student enrolled in the program.ED must establish a process for an IHE with an educational program that has lost eligibility for federal funds to be able to apply to regain eligibility for such funds.IHEs&nbsp;must comply with these requirements beginning on July 1, 2026.Subtitle F--Regulatory Relief(Sec. 85001) This section delays until July 1, 2035, ED regulations pertaining to borrower defense to repayment. It restores those regulations that were in effect on July 1, 2020.(Sec. 85002) This section delays until July 1, 2035, ED regulations pertaining to closed school discharges. It restores those regulations that were in effect prior to changes made in November 2022.Subtitle G--Garden of Heroes(Sec. 86001)&nbsp;This section provides additional funding for FY2025&nbsp;to the&nbsp;National Endowment for the Humanities (1) to establish and maintain a statuary park named the National Garden of American Heroes; (2) to procure statues for the National Garden of American Heroes; and (3)&nbsp;for events, celebrations, and activities related to the 250th anniversary of America’s founding.Subtitle H--Office of Refugee Resettlement(Sec. 87001) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to&nbsp;the Office of Refugee Resettlement for specified activities, such as background checks and home studies of potential sponsors of unaccompanied children.TITLE IX--COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS&nbsp;Subtitle A--Homeland Security Provisions&nbsp;This subtitle provides funding for border security.(Sec. 90001) This section provides funding to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for construction, installation, or improvement to barriers; access roads; detection technology; and other work to prepare the ground at or near the U.S.&nbsp;border.&nbsp;(Sec. 90002) This section provides funding for CBP personnel, bonuses, facilities, and fleet vehicles.(Sec. 90003) This section provides funding to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for increased capacity in detention facilities for the purposes of detaining adults and families who are non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law).(Sec. 90004) This section provides funding for&nbsp;CBP inspection and surveillance equipment, screenings (including of unaccompanied children), rapid air and marine response capabilities, vetting, and activities to prevent drug trafficking.(Sec. 90005) This section provides funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (1) to assist state and local authorities to detect, identify, track, or monitor unmanned aircraft systems; (2) for security, planning, and other costs related to the 2026 FIFA World Cup; (3) for security, planning, and other costs related to the 2028 Olympics; and (4) for the Operation Stonegarden grant program.The section also establishes a fund in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reimburse states and units of local government for costs associated with border security actions taken on or after January 20, 2021. Specifically, DHS shall provide grants for (1) barriers along the southern U.S. border, (2) the detection and interception of certain individuals and illicit drugs, and (3) the relocation of&nbsp;non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) from small population centers to other domestic locations. &nbsp;(Sec. 90006) This section provides funding to FEMA to reimburse state and local law enforcement for extraordinary costs associated with protecting a residence of the President.&nbsp;(Sec. 90007) This section provides funding to&nbsp;DHS for reimbursement of costs incurred for activities in support of safeguarding U.S. borders.Subtitle B--Governmental Affairs ProvisionsThis subtitle revises the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program.FEHB Protection Act of 2025(Sec. 90101) This section requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to issue regulations and implement a process to verify (1) the veracity of any qualifying life event through which an enrollee in the FEHB Program seeks to add a family member for coverage under the program; and (2) that, when an enrollee seeks to add a family member to the FEHB program, the individual added is a qualifying family member.The section also requires OPM to conduct a comprehensive audit regarding family members enrolled in the FEHB program. In conducting this audit, OPM must review marriage certificates, birth certificates, and other appropriate documents to determine eligibility.OPM must develop a process to disenroll or remove an individual who is not eligible to participate in the FEHB program. &nbsp;The section allows for some Employees Health Benefits Fund amounts to be available to OPM in FY2026 to carry out eligibility verification requirements and audit activities.(Sec. 90102) This section provides FY2026 funding for the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee to support oversight of the coronavirus response and of funds provided pertaining to the coronavirus pandemic. The section extends the committee to September 30, 2034 (currently, the committee terminates on September 30, 2025).(Sec. 90103) This section provides FY2025 funding to the Office of Management and Budget for purposes of finding budget and accounting efficiencies in the executive branch.TITLE X--COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARYSubtitle A--Immigration and Law Enforcement MattersPart I--Immigration FeesThis part establishes additional or increased fees for various immigration programs and procedures.These fees include those required forapplications for asylum,employment authorizations for asylees, parolees, and individuals granted temporary protected status,individuals paroled into the United States,individuals applying for special immigrant juvenile status,individuals applying for Temporary Protected Status, andindividuals issued a nonimmigrant visa.(Sec. 100013) This section establishes various fees for specified judicial and adjudicative filings, includingfiling in immigration court an application for waiver of grounds of inadmissibility,filing an appeal of a decision of an immigration judge or a DHS officer, anda practitioner filing an appeal in a disciplinary case.&nbsp;Part II--Immigration and Law Enforcement FundingThis part provides funding for various immigration agencies and offices for purposes of immigration enforcement, removal, maintenance of facilities, and program operations. This includes the Department of Homeland Security,&nbsp;the Executive Office for Immigration Review, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Justice, and the performance of immigration officer functions by state officers and employees.(Sec. 100056) This section provides funding for the Bureau of Prisons for salaries, benefits, and facilities.&nbsp;(Sec. 100057) This section provides funding for the U.S. Secret Service for personnel, bonuses, training facilities, programming, and technology.Subtitle B--Judiciary Matters(Sec. 100101) This section provides funding for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts for the purpose of analysis and reporting regarding the state of the dockets of the courts, including metrics regarding judicial orders for non-party relief against the federal government.(Sec. 100102) This section provides funding for the Federal Judicial Center for the purpose of carrying out continuing education and training for personnel of the judicial branch, including training on non-party relief against the federal government.Subtitle C--Radiation Exposure Compensation MattersThis subtitle reestablishes and expands a program to compensate individuals who were exposed to radiation during certain nuclear testing or uranium mining and who subsequently developed medical conditions, particularly cancer. This program compensated individuals who were present in a designated geographic area during a period of nuclear testing and certain individuals employed in uranium mining. The subtitleexpands the designated areas to include Idaho and New Mexico and additional areas in Nevada and Utah;makes more individuals who worked in uranium mining eligible for the program;increases the amount of compensation awarded to new eligible claimants; andextends through 2028 the fund that supports this program and extends through 2027 the statute of limitations for filing claims (the program expired in 2024).The subtitle also expands this program to compensate individuals located in specified areas of Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska, or Kentucky associated with waste from the Manhattan Project and who subsequently developed specified types of cancer.&nbsp; This act reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by several congressional committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House or Senate Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRYThis title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).Subtitle A--Nutrition(Sec. 10101)&nbsp;This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.As background, USDA created the TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.(Sec. 10102) This section increases the work requirements for certain SNAP recipients&nbsp;who are able-bodied adults.As background,&nbsp;SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) currently have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements. SNAP law limits benefits to ABAWDs to 3 months out of a 36-month period, unless the participant meets the additional work-related requirements.This section raises the age for those who must meet these additional work requirements to include adults who are 65 years old and younger, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are 55 years old and younger.This section requires parents and household members to meet the additional work requirements (similar to someone who does not have a dependent child) if the child is age 14 and older. Currently, those with a child under the age of 18 are exempt from the requirements.This section&nbsp;excludes from the additional work requirements SNAP recipients who are Indians, Urban Indians, or California Indians (as these terms are defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act).&nbsp;In addition, the section generally requires homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals&nbsp;to meet these work requirements. Foster care individuals are&nbsp;those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age.&nbsp;Specifically, this section eliminates the current exclusion from the additional work requirements for these individuals based on this status.Finally, this section limits the ability of a state to temporarily suspend the three-month time limit for SNAP benefits for ABAWDS in areas with high unemployment or an insufficient number of jobs. Under current law, the ABAWD waiver program allows states to request a temporary waiver of the three-month SNAP benefit limit. States may receive a waiver based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs.The section repeals the provision that allows a state waiver if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs. Further, the section allows Alaska and Hawaii to qualify for the state exemption with an unemployment rate that is at or above 1.5 times the national unemployment rate, effectively lowering the unemployment rate that these states must meet to receive a waiver.&nbsp;(Sec. 10103) This section generally eliminates the ability of a household to use participation in certain energy assistance programs to determine SNAP income eligibility unless&nbsp;the household includes an elderly or disabled member.&nbsp;As background, a household may deduct a portion of their housing and utility costs from their income (i.e., the excess shelter expense deduction) when determining SNAP benefits. Under current law, a household that receives a certain level of energy assistance through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program may deduct a set allowance. This set allowance&nbsp;(i.e., Standard Utility Allowance or SUA) represents low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Using this allowance makes qualifying for an excess shelter deduction more likely.This section&nbsp;eliminates the use of the set allowance for households without elderly or disabled members, which may decrease the availability of the excess shelter deduction and reduce the SNAP benefits for these households.(Sec.&nbsp;10104)&nbsp;This section prohibits a household from using any internet connection service fees as part of their housing and utility costs for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits, thus potentially reducing the SNAP benefits for these households.As background, a household may deduct a portion of their housing and utility costs from their income (i.e., the excess shelter expense&nbsp;deduction) when determining SNAP benefits.&nbsp;Under current law, household expenses may include&nbsp;internet connection service fees.(Sec. 10105) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments&nbsp;beginning in FY2028. The state contribution ranges from 0% to 15% for the cost of SNAP program allotments and is based on the state’s SNAP payment error rate. Currently, the state match is 0%.For FY2028, a state may elect either the FY2025 or FY2026 payment error rate to calculate its state-matching fund requirement. For FY2029 and each fiscal year thereafter, the state match is calculated using the payment error rate for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the state share is being calculated.Any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% will have a state match of 0% (i.e., the state does not have to contribute).&nbsp;A state with a payment error rate that isat least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 5%,at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 10%, and10% or greater must contribute 15%.In general,&nbsp;the&nbsp;effective date for the state-matching fund requirements&nbsp;is the beginning of FY2028. However, any state that has an error rate above a certain level will have implementation delayed until FY2029 or&nbsp;FY2030. Specifically, the implementation date is delayed for states where the state's error rate multiplied by 1.5 equals or exceeds 20% in FY2025 or FY2026. For such states, the implementation date is delayed until FY2029 if the specified error rate occurs in FY2025 and until FY2030 if the error rate occurs in FY2026.&nbsp;(Sec. 10106) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs beginning in FY2027 and for each fiscal year thereafter. Currently, USDA must pay 50% of all administrative costs, thus this section increases the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.(Sec. 10107) This section eliminates funding for the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED). SNAP state and local agencies administer this federal grant program. SNAP-Ed uses evidence-based, public health projects and interventions with the goal to implement a nutrition education and obesity prevention program for eligible individuals that promotes healthy food choices and physical activity consistent with the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans.(Sec. 10108) This section&nbsp;eliminates SNAP eligibility for certain individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law and legally present in the United States, including those who have qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws or&nbsp;based on urgent humanitarian&nbsp;reasons (e.g., a&nbsp;survivor of domestic violence or human trafficking).The section maintains SNAP eligibility for&nbsp;individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals; (2) lawful permanent residents, with exceptions; (3) aliens who are Cuban or Haitian&nbsp;entrants; or (4) individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and&nbsp;Palau.Subtitle B-- Forestry(Sec. 10201) This section rescinds certain funds provided to the Forest Service as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. For example, this includes the rescission of funds for&nbsp;the protection of old-growth forests on National Forest System land,grants for nonfederal forest landowners for climate mitigation or forest resilience practices,grants for state and private forestry conservation programs for tree planting, andadministrative costs for the National Forest System to implement these and other related programs.Subtitle C--CommoditiesThis subtitle amends and extends commodity support programs.For example, the subtitle extends the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC)&nbsp; program, and Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.(Sec. 10301) This section increases the reference prices for specified commodities under the ARC and&nbsp;PLC programs for crop years 2025 through 2030. This change would increase the likelihood of triggering a payment and increase the payments made to eligible producers when triggered.Beginning in crop year 2031, USDA must increase the reference price so that it is equal to the reference price in the previous crop year multiplied by 1.005. USDA must continue to increase the reference price using this formula for each crop year after 2031, up to a maximum of 113% of the 2030 reference price.The ARC and&nbsp;PLC programs, administered by the Farm Service Agency, offer financial assistance to eligible agricultural producers, and the reference prices are used to calculate benefits under the programs.&nbsp;The ARC program is an income support program that provides payments to producers triggered when actual crop revenue declines below a specified guarantee level. The&nbsp;PLC program provides income support payments triggered when the effective price for a covered commodity falls below its effective reference price.(Sec. 10302) This section grants eligible agricultural producers a one-time option to expand and allocate base acre holdings in proportion to average 2019-2023 plantings of covered and&nbsp;noncovered commodities. In general, the Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage programs make payments per enrolled base acre (i.e., a unit of production associated with specific tracts of farmland in proportion to historical production of certain crops).This section allows producers to allocate existing unassigned base acres to a covered commodity. The section limits the total existing unassigned and newly granted base acres to no more than 30 million acres, effectively increasing total base acres nationwide from approximately 274 million to approximately 304 million.(Sec. 10303)&nbsp;This section requires producers to make an election to obtain ARC or PLC on a covered-commodity-by-covered commodity basis through crop year 2031.&nbsp;For the 2025 crop year, this section requires USDA, on a covered commodity-by-covered commodity basis, to make the higher of PLC payments or ARC county coverage payments to the producers on a farm for the payment acres for each covered commodity on the&nbsp;farm.(Sec. 10304) This section extends the&nbsp;PLC program through crop year 2031.(Sec. 10305) This section extends the ARC program through the 2031 crop year. It also increases the coverage guarantee level from 86% to 90% of the benchmark revenue and increases the maximum payment amount&nbsp;from 10% to 12.5% of the&nbsp;benchmark revenue. These changes increase the likelihood of triggering a payment and increase the payments made to eligible producers when triggered. &nbsp;(Sec. 10306) This section establishes a definition for a qualified pass-through entity, which includes certain partnerships and S corporations (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) and certain limited liability companies, joint ventures, and general partnerships. It also generally requires these entities to be treated in the same manner as current law treats general partnerships and joint ventures for the purpose of payment limitations. For example, the section replaces an existing exception to payment limitations for joint ventures and general partnerships with an exception for qualified pass-through entities.(Sec. 10307) This section increases the maximum ARC and&nbsp;PLC&nbsp;payment limit per person from $125,000 to $155,000. A producer is eligible to receive up to $155,000 in peanut payments and up to $155,000 in payments for all commodities except peanuts (i.e., up to $310,000 total for all commodities inclusive). USDA must adjust payment limits for inflation annually beginning with the 2025 crop year.As background, certain payment limits and eligibility criteria apply to multiple farm programs, including ARC,&nbsp;PLC, and certain disaster assistance programs and conservation programs.(Sec. 10308) This section waives the adjusted gross income (AGI) limitations for payments or benefits under certain USDA disaster assistance and conservation programs for a person or legal entity that derives a portion of their income from agriculture. Specifically, the exception allows producers and business entities whose AGI exceeds $900,000 to participate in certain disaster assistance and conservation programs if 75% or more of their AGI (i.e., gross income before applying adjustments to calculate the AGI) is derived from eligible agricultural activities.The eligible activities are farming, ranching, or siviculture activities, including&nbsp;agritourism, direct-to-consumer marketing of agricultural products, and the sale of agricultural equipment owned by such person or entity.(Sec. 10309) This section extends the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program nonrecourse and recourse loans through the 2031 crop year. It also sets MAL rates for crop years 2026-2031. This section also extends Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs) through the 2031 crop year. The MAL and LDP programs provide price support to producers when market prices drop below statutory levels.This section also extends the Special Competitive Provisions for Extra Long Staple (ELS) Cotton program. This program makes payments to eligible mills that use ELS cotton and eligible exporters of ELS cotton.As background, there are two main species of cotton cultivated for commercial use, upland cotton (which comprises 97% of U.S. production) and extra-long staple (ELS) cotton. U.S.-grown ELS cotton is also referred to as Pima cotton.(Sec. 10310) This section changes how world prices for upland and ELS cotton are calculated for the purpose of repaying&nbsp;MALs.(Sec. 10311) This section increases the payments to domestic users of upland cotton who participate in the Economic Adjustment Assistance for Textile Mills program. This program makes monthly payments to eligible domestic cotton mills. The payments must be used for capital investments that contribute to domestic manufacturing of upland cotton.(Sec. 10312) This section makes several modification to USDA's sugar program.&nbsp;As background, the U.S. sugar program supports the U.S. sugar industry (i.e., producers and processors of sugarcane and sugar beets) by providing Marketing Assistance Loans (MALs) to sugar processors, restricting domestic supply of sugar with marketing allotments for sugar processors, and limiting sugar imports through tariff-rate quotas.Specifically, this section increases the marketing loan rate for raw sugar cane processors and increases the rate for beet sugar processors for crop years 2025-2031.This section also increases the storage rates USDA pays to processors for forfeited refined sugar and forfeited raw cane sugar. Under current law, when sugar is used to&nbsp;collateralize a MAL loan and is forfeited by a sugar processor, USDA must provide payments to the processors who store the forfeited sugar.This section extends the provisions for the flexible marketing allotments for sugar through crop year 2031. In addition, in operating sugar support programs, USDA must prioritize sugar beet processors if marketing allotments are adjusted higher. Additionally, if sugar beet marketing allotments need to be adjusted, USDA must reassign sugar beet marketing allotments within 30 days of the publication of USDA's January World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report.&nbsp;Finally, USDA must study whether the establishment of additional terms and conditions with respect to refined sugar imports is necessary and appropriate and submit a report to Congress. Based on the study, USDA may issue regulations to establish additional terms and conditions for refined sugar imports.(Sec. 10313) This section extends Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) through crop year 2031 and provides for a number of changes to the DMC program.As background, DMC allows participating milk producers to buy a guaranteed margin for their milk production.&nbsp;The DMC program pays participating producers the difference between a producer-selected guarantee and the national milk margin (all-milk price minus an average feed cost ration). Margin payments are based on producers' milk production history, not actual milk marketings (i.e., quantity of milk sold). Producers pay annual premium rates based on two tiers of production history.Changes to the program includealtering how USDA determines&nbsp;production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;setting production history for the DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;raising the coverage limit to the first 6 million pounds of production history for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first 5 million pounds; andallowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.(Sec. 10314)&nbsp; This section requires USDA to make available specified funds to carry out this subtitle. It also requires USDA to use specified funds to administer a mandatory survey of dairy product manufacturers' production costs and product yield information. USDA must&nbsp;publish the results of the surveys&nbsp;biennially.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subtitle D--Disaster Assistance ProgramsThis subtitle expands the types of eligible losses covered under the permanently authorized agricultural disaster assistance programs, which include the Livestock Indemnity Program; the Livestock Forage Disaster Program; the&nbsp;Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program; and the&nbsp;Tree Assistance Program. This subtitle also increases coverage levels and lowers the threshold for triggering payments for certain eligible losses.(Sec. 10401) Under the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), this section increases the payment rate to 100%, from 75%, for losses due to predation (i.e., attacks by animals reintroduced into the wild by the federal government or protected by federal law). This section also authorizes USDA to allow eligible producers to submit documentation to assist in determining an animal's market value. Further, the section expands LIP coverage to include unborn livestock as LIP- eligible livestock losses. LIP provides indemnity payments to eligible livestock owners and contract growers for livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality or reduced sales prices due to specified events (e.g., adverse weather, disease, or animal attack).Under the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), this section expands the types of eligible drought conditions covered and increases payments for certain eligible drought conditions under the program. The LFP program makes payments to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses due to&nbsp;drought-affected pastureland&nbsp;or a fire on federally managed rangelands.Under the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), this section expands eligible losses to include bird predation of farm-raised fish and adds an eligible loss threshold when determining honey bee colony losses. ELAP provides payments to producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish as compensation for losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, or other conditions that are not covered under other programs.Under the Tree Assistance Program (TAP), this section lowers the eligible normal mortality loss threshold and increases assistance for eligible rehabilitation costs. TAP provides financial assistance to qualifying orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate eligible trees, bushes, and vines damaged by natural disasters.Subtitle&nbsp;E--Crop InsuranceThis subtitle increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies and increases additional premium subsidies available for beginning farmers and ranchers. The subtitle also increases coverage levels for Supplemental Coverage Option&nbsp;(i.e., a type of county-level coverage) and Whole Farm Revenue Protection policies, increases support for administrative and operating (A&amp;O) costs incurred by approved crop insurance providers, and increases funds available for program compliance and integrity.As background, the Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP) offers subsidized crop insurance policies that producers can purchase to cover a wide variety of crops and livestock. These policies pay indemnities for yield and revenue losses caused by adverse growing and market conditions, including natural disasters. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)—a government corporation within USDA—subsidizes part of the policy premium.(Sec. 10501) This section increases the premium subsidies available for beginning farmers or ranchers for an applicable insurance policy or plan.Further, farmers and ranchers are eligible to qualify for the program for 10 years, an increase from 5 years. Specifically, a farmer or rancher must not have actively operated and managed a farm or ranch for more than 10 crop years to be considered a beginning farmer or rancher.&nbsp;(Sec. 10502) This section expands the maximum coverage level from 85% to 90% for individual yield or revenue coverage aggregated across multiple commodities (e.g., Whole-Farm Revenue Protection policies). &nbsp;The section also expands the&nbsp;Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) and increases SCO premium subsidies from 65% to 80%. It also increases the SCO coverage level from 86% to 90%.(Sec. 10503) This section increases administrative and operating (A&amp;O) subsidies in certain states and years with relatively high losses.As background, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) subsidizes part of the policy premium. The policyholders (i.e., farmers and ranchers)&nbsp;pay any remaining premium. Private insurance companies&nbsp;sell and service the policies in return for A&amp;O subsidies from the FCIC.This section also establishes a minimum A&amp;O reimbursement&nbsp;rate for specialty crop policies&nbsp;each year beginning in the 2026 reinsurance year. The rate must be equal to or greater than the percentage that is the greater of (1) 17% of the premium used to define loss ratio, and (2) the percentage of the premium used to define loss ratio that is otherwise applicable for the reinsurance year under the terms of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement in effect for the reinsurance year.Finally, beginning with the 2026 reinsurance year, the section requires&nbsp;USDA to annually increase the total A&amp;O reimbursements that would otherwise be required in order to account for inflation.(Sec. 10504) This section increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies. The increases range from 3% to 5%, depending on the coverage level.(Sec. 10505) This section increases funding for available information technologies (i.e., data mining and data warehousing) to administer and enforce program compliance and integrity.(Sec. 10506) This section increases funding for (1) the operations and review of policies, plans of insurance, and related materials; and&nbsp;(2) maintaining program actuarial soundness and financial integrity.&nbsp;(Sec. 10507) This section provides for the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program to provide contract poultry growers with&nbsp;index-based insurance for&nbsp;extreme weather-related risk resulting in increased utility costs&nbsp;associated with poultry production. Under an index policy, claim payments are generally triggered based on a predetermined index that is entirely independent of the individual farm operation (e.g., rainfall level). Under such a policy, the payments are automatically triggered when the index reaches a certain level rather than when an insured farmer files a claim.Subtitle F--Additional Investments in Rural America&nbsp;(Sec. 10601) This section rescinds the unobligated funds that were provided for the Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), and the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP)&nbsp; as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The section also adds funds to the&nbsp;permanent farm bill baseline for these programs. It also reauthorizes or modifies the funding levels for various other conservation programs.The section provides the following funding levels for ACEP:$625 million for FY2026,$650 million for FY2027,$675 million for FY2028, and$700 million for each of FY2029-FY2031.The section provides the following funding levels for EQIP:$2.655 billion for FY2026,$2.855 billion for FY2027, and$3.255 billion for each of FY2028-FY2031.The section provides the following funding&nbsp;levels for CSP:$1.300 billion for FY2026,$1.325 billion for FY2027,$1.350 billion for FY2028, and$1.375 billion for each of FY2029-FY2031.The section provides the following funding levels&nbsp; for RCPP:$425 million for FY2026, and$450 million each of FY2027-FY2031.In addition, this section reauthorizes or modifies the funding levels for the following programsGrassroots Source Water Protection Program,Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program,Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program, andFeral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program.(Sec. 10602)&nbsp;This section directs USDA to carry out a program to encourage the accessibility, development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. This section also provides $285 million in mandatory funding for the program for FY2027 and each fiscal year thereafter.(Sec. 10603)&nbsp;This section extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).&nbsp;Through TEFAP, USDA purchases a variety of commodities and makes those food products (e.g., canned, frozen, dried, and fresh fruits and vegetables; eggs; meat; dairy; and whole-grain and enriched grain products) available to state distributing agencies.(Sec. 10604)&nbsp;This section reauthorizes and provides funding for a number of USDA research initiatives.The section reauthorizes and extends funding through FY2031 for the Urban, Indoor, and other Emerging Agricultural Production Research, Education, and Extension Initiative, a National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) competitive grant program that supports research, education, and extension activities that facilitate development of urban, indoor, and other emerging agricultural production systems.The section provides $37 million for the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, a nonprofit corporation established to advance the research mission of USDA by supporting research activities focused on key problems of national and international significance.The section provides specified funds to the 1890 National Scholars Program for FY2026 for student scholarships. This NIFA program provides grants to 1890 Institutions (i.e., historically Black colleges and universities that belong to the U.S. land-grant university system) for students who intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.The section provides funding for the&nbsp;Assistive Technology Program for Farmers with Disabilities Program (AgrAbility) grant program for FY2026. This NIFA program supports&nbsp;projects that provide&nbsp;agricultural education and assistance to farmers with disabilities&nbsp;and their family members.This section provides the Specialty Crop Research Initiative with $175 million in mandatory funding for FY2026. Currently, the program is funded at $80 million for each fiscal year.This section also provides funding for competitive grants to assist in the construction, alteration, acquisition, modernization, renovation, or remodeling of Agricultural Research Facilities.(Sec. 10605)&nbsp;This section reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels (i.e., Advanced Biofuel Payment Program) through FY2031. The program provides payments to fuel producers to support and expand production of advanced biofuels (i.e., not derived from corn starch).(Sec. 10606)&nbsp;This section provides additional funding for the Plant Pest and Disease Management Disaster Prevention Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter.This section provides additional funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter. Under the block grant program, USDA provides grants to the state departments of agriculture to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops (i.e., fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, including floriculture).The section also reauthorizes, and extends funding for, organic production and market data initiatives through FY2031.This section reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for USDA to carry out the modernization and improvement of international trade technology systems and data collection on imports of organically produced agricultural products accepted into the United States.The section also reauthorizes&nbsp;through FY2031&nbsp;the Organic Certification Cost Share Program, which provides cost share assistance to producers and handlers of agricultural products who are obtaining or renewing their certification under the National Organic Program.This section reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for the multiple crop and pesticide use survey of farmers. The USDA Office of Pest Management Policy conducts this survey to collect data for risk assessment modeling and mitigation for an active ingredient.(Sec. 10607) This section increases mandatory&nbsp;funding for the National Animal Health Laboratory Network&nbsp;from $30 million per fiscal year to$233 million for each of FY2026-FY2030, and$75 million for FY2031 and each fiscal year thereafter.Specific increases in funding are provided for the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and the National Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank.This section extends and increases funding for the Sheep Production &amp; Marketing Grant Program through FY2026. This program seeks to strengthen and enhance the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.This section also extends thePima Agriculture Cotton Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on cotton fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of cotton fabric;Agriculture Wool Apparel Manufacturers Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on wool fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of wool fabric;Wool Research and Promotion Program through FY2031, which provides grants to assist U.S. wool producers with improving the quality of wool and with developing and promoting the wool market; andEmergency Citrus Disease Research and Development Trust Fund through FY2031, which funds a program that aims to bring together scientists to find scientifically sound and financially sustainable solutions to&nbsp;Huanglongbing (i.e., citrus greening, a bacterial disease spread by an insect that feeds on citrus).&nbsp;TITLE II--COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICESThis title provides additional funding for, and modifies, various defense and national security projects and programs.(Sec. 20001) This section provides $7.5 billion in additional funding for FY2025 to the Department of Defense (DOD) for military personnel quality of life, which includes specified amounts forthe Marine Corps Barracks 2030 initiative,the Defense Health Program,supplemental payments of Basic Allowance for Housing to military personnel, andtuition assistance and child care assistance for members of the Armed Forces.The section also provides statutory authority to extend from 14 to 21 days eligibility for Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) for certain servicemembers undergoing a permanent change of station.Additionally, the section temporarily increases authorized investment amounts and provides additional authorization for the acquisition or construction of certain military housing through private contracts.(Sec. 20002) This section provides $29.2 billion in additional funding for FY2025 for the shipbuilding industrial base and various naval shipbuilding activities.&nbsp;(Sec. 20003) This section provides $24.4 billion in additional funding for FY2025 for the development of (1) space-based missile intercept capabilities, (2) military space-based sensors, and (3) the continued development of ground-based missile defense systems and related infrastructure.(Sec. 20004) This section provides $25.4 billion in additional funding for FY2025 for various military weapon systems, including hypersonic, air-to-air, cruise, and anti-ship missiles.This amount also&nbsp;includes&nbsp;additional funding for FY2025 for the Industrial Base Fund.(Sec. 20005) This section provides $16 billion in additional funding for FY2025 to expand the small, unmanned aerial system (UAS) industrial base, to advance the use of artificial intelligence in these and other systems, and to support the integration of commercial developments in military technology.This amount also includes additional funding to finance loans and loan guarantees by the DOD Office of Strategic Capital.(Sec. 20006) This section provides $380 million in&nbsp;additional funding for FY2025 to replace current business systems, deploy automation, and deploy artificial intelligence to accelerate audits of DOD financial statements.(Sec. 20007) This section provides $8.6 billion in additional funding for FY2025 to (1) modernize the capabilities of fighter, transport, and other military aircraft; (2) prevent the retirement of certain fighter aircraft (e.g., F-22); and (3) produce next-generation manned and unmanned aircraft.(Sec. 20008) This section provides $14.7 billion in additional funding for FY2025 for nuclear defense resources and nuclear forces development and production.&nbsp;This includes additional funding to expand the production capacity of the B-21 long-range bomber aircraft.This amount also&nbsp;includes additional funding for FY2025 for&nbsp;the National Nuclear Security Administration.(Sec. 20009) This section provides $12.7 billion in additional funding for FY2025 for (1) various military exercises and infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region, and (2) the development and procurement of military&nbsp;satellites.(Sec. 20010) This section provides $16.3 billion in additional funding for FY2025 to enhance and modernize (1) military depots and shipyards, (2) Special Operations Command (SOCOM) equipment, and (3) Air Force facilities.&nbsp;(Sec. 20011) This section provides $1 billion in additional funding for FY2025 to support border operations, including deployment of military personnel.(Sec. 20012) This section provides $10 million in additional funding for FY2025 for the DOD Office of Inspector General to monitor the activities for which funding is provided under this title.(Sec. 20013) This section authorizes each military department to use funding under this title for military construction, land acquisition, and military family housing. Each military department must submit a detailed spending plan to Congress.TITLE III--COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS(Sec. 30001) This section reduces funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).&nbsp;Specifically, the section reduces from 12% to 6.5% the cap on the percentage of combined earnings transferred from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board to the&nbsp;CFPB.(Sec. 30002) This section rescinds unobligated funds from the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program under the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The program provides funding for energy efficiency improvements in multifamily properties receiving HUD assistance.(Sec. 30003) This section closes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Reserve Fund and transfers the remaining amounts to the general fund of the Treasury. The fund, which pays for SEC expenses and is not subject to annual appropriation, was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and is funded by securities registration fees.(Sec. 30004) This section provides additional funding of $1 billion to carry out activities under the Defense Production Act of 1950. The act confers on the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in the interest of national defense, such as requiring industries to accept contracts for national defense purposes.&nbsp;TITLE IV--COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION(Sec. 40001) This section provides the Coast Guard with over $24.5 billion in additional funds for FY2025, to remain available through FY2029, to use expedited processes to (1) procure or acquire new operational assets and&nbsp;systems; (2) maintain existing assets and systems; (3) design, construct, plan, engineer, and improve necessary shore infrastructure; and (4) enhance operational resilience for monitoring, search and rescue, interdiction, hardening of maritime approaches, and navigational safety.This includes specified funds for various cutters and other programs. Cutters are Coast Guard vessels that are more than 65 feet long and have accommodations for a crew. (Those less than 65 feet long are called boats.)This title includes&nbsp;specified funds forfixed and rotary wing aircraft,long-range unmanned aircraft and base stations,Offshore Patrol Cutters,Fast Response Cutters,Polar Security Cutters,Arctic Security Cutters,light and medium&nbsp;icebreaking cutters,shore facilities, anddepot maintenance.(Sec. 40002) This section renews the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to auction licenses for the use of radio frequency spectrum and requires the FCC to auction at least 800 megahertz of spectrum within a specified time frame.Specifically, this section reauthorizes the FCC’s use of competitive bidding (i.e., auctions) to grant licenses for the use of specific frequencies through September 30, 2034. (The FCC’s auction authority must be renewed by Congress periodically. It expired on March 9, 2023, and has not been renewed.)&nbsp;However, the FCC is not authorized to auction certain frequencies used primarily by the Department of Defense.During this period of renewed auction authority, the FCC is required to auction at least 300 megahertz of spectrum, including at least 100 megahertz in specified frequencies (known as the Upper C-Band) within two years of this title’s enactment.Further, within four years of this title’s enactment, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) must identify 500 megahertz of additional&nbsp;spectrum currently allocated to the federal government for reallocation and auction.Specifically, the NTIA must select spectrum&nbsp;at frequencies between 1.3 and 10.5 gigahertz for reallocation to nonfederal use or shared federal use for full-power commercial licensed use cases (e.g., commercial mobile phone service). In selecting spectrum for reallocation, the NTIA must assess the feasibility of reallocating specific frequencies with the goal of maximizing auction proceeds.The FCC must auction the frequencies identified for reallocation within a specified time frame, and must complete auctions for the full 500 megahertz within eight years of this title’s enactment.&nbsp;If necessary to protect U.S. national security, the President must modify or withdraw any frequency identified for reallocation at least 60 days before an auction of that frequency.Finally, this section provides funding for the NTIA to conduct a timely spectrum analysis of certain frequency bands and to publish reports, biennially through 2034, on the value of all spectrum used by federal entities.(Sec. 40003) This section provides the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with $12.52 billion in&nbsp;additional funds for FY2025, to remain available through FY2029, for the acquisition, construction, sustainment, and improvement of facilities and equipment necessary to improve or maintain aviation safety. This includes&nbsp;$4.75 billion for telecommunications infrastructure modernization and systems upgrades and $3 billion for&nbsp;radar systems replacement.This&nbsp;also includes specified funds for&nbsp;runway safety technologies, runway lighting systems, and airport surface surveillance technologies;Automated Weather Observing Systems and Visual Weather Observing Systems;the Don Young Alaska Aviation Safety Initiative;a new air route traffic control center (ARTCC) and an&nbsp;ARTCC Realignment and Consolidation Effort;recapitalization and consolidation of terminal radar approach control facilities (TRACONs);the deployment of remote tower technology at untowered airports; andair traffic controller advanced training technologies.The FAA must submit a report to Congress every 90 days on these expenditures.(Sec. 40004) This section requires the FAA to impose a specified fee on each commercial space launch or reentry carried out beginning in 2026.&nbsp;This section also establishes an account within the U.S. Treasury wherein all commercial space launch and reentry fees must be deposited. The FAA must use a certain portion of such funds for (1) expenses of the FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which administers commercial space launch and reentry permitting; and (2) a project to expedite the development, acquisition, and deployment of technologies or capabilities to aid in space launch and reentry integration.(Sec. 40005) This section provides&nbsp;$9.995 billion to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for Moon and Mars missions, infrastructure improvements at NASA facilities, and other NASA projects.Specifically, this section includes funding for the procurement of a high-performance Mars telecommunications orbiter; for the procurement and operation of the Space Launch System for Artemis missions IV and&nbsp;V; and for expenses related to the operation and eventual deorbiting of the International Space Station.This section also requires NASA to identify a space vehicle that has carried astronauts and flown in space to be relocated and placed on public display near a NASA field center. The space vehicle must be transported to this new location within 18 months of this title’s enactment. This section provides funding to NASA to carry out this requirement, including certain funds that must be transferred to a selected entity for the construction of a facility to house the space vehicle.(Sec. 40006) This section effectively eliminates the civil penalty for a violation by a manufacturer of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and the ability of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to enforce the standards. Under current law, NHTSA’s&nbsp;CAFE standards regulate how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. NHTSA enforces the standards through civil penalties. This section sets the civil penalty to $0 for a violation by a manufacturer of the CAFE standards.(Sec. 40007) This section increases the amount of the lease payment that the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) must pay&nbsp;to the federal government for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport.&nbsp;Specifically, MWAA must pay $15 million per year (adjusted annually for inflation) beginning in&nbsp;2027. This amount must be renegotiated at least once every 10 years to ensure that the amount is not less than $15 million in 2027 dollars. Under current law,&nbsp;for 2025, the projected payment is approximately $7.5 million.(Sec. 40008) This section rescinds specified funds that were provided to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for certain facilities, activities, and research.Specifically, this section rescinds funds that were provided to&nbsp;NOAA for (1) the provision of financial or technical assistance to coastal states and other entities for conservation, restoration, and protection of coastal and marine habitats and to enable preparation for extreme weather; (2) NOAA facilities, including piers, fisheries laboratories, and national marine sanctuaries; (3) reviews of planning, permitting, and approval processes; and (4) weather research and forecasting innovations, including a grant program to support climate research.(Sec. 40009) This section reduces funding for the&nbsp;Corporation for Travel Promotion (i.e.,&nbsp;Brand USA) to $20 million per year through FY2027 from the current level of $100 million per year. Established by the Travel Promotion Act of 2009, Brand USA is a public-private partnership tasked with promoting tourism in the United States.(Sec. 40010) This section rescinds the unobligated balances for the FAA Alternative Fuel and Low-Emission Aviation Technology Program, which includes the Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) program, that was funded as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The purpose of the program is to provide competitive grants for projects located in the United States that (1) produce, transport, blend, or store sustainable aviation fuel; or (2) develop, demonstrate, or apply low-emission aviation technologies.(Sec. 40011) This section rescinds specified funds that were provided for the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund, a competitive grant program administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration that funds efforts to accelerate the development, deployment, and adoption of Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN). (Radio Access Networks connect individual user devices [e.g., cell phones and laptops] to broader telecommunications networks.

Beginning in 2025, under this section, a taxpayer must provide a work-eligible Social Security number for themselves, for their spouse (if filing jointly), and for each qualifying child.(Sec. 70105) This section makes permanent the qualified business income (QBI) tax deduction, expands the phase-in range of the limitations on the QBI tax deduction to $75,000 for non-joint returns&nbsp;and $150,000 for joint filers (from $50,000 for non-joint returns and $100,000 for joint filers), and establishes a minimum QBI tax deduction of $400 for certain taxpayers.(Sec. 70106) This section increases the base estate tax, gift tax, and generation-skipping transfer tax exemption amount after 2025 to $15 million (from $5 million), adjusted for inflation.(Sec. 70107) This section makes permanent the increased alternative minimum tax exemption amounts and reduces the alternative minimum taxable income threshold amount to $500,000 ($1 million for joint filers) at which the exemption amounts begin to phase out (adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2026). (For 2025, the alternative minimum taxable income threshold amounts are $626,350 or $1,252,700 for joint filers, as adjusted for inflation.)Further, this section increases the percentage rate to 50% (from 25%) at which the alternative minimum tax exemption amount is phased out for individuals whose taxable income exceeds such threshold amount.(Sec. 70108) This section makes permanent the limit on the itemized tax deduction for home mortgage interest enacted in 2017 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Thus, under this section, taxpayers who itemize their tax deductions may deduct interest paid on the first $750,000 (or $375,000 for married individuals filing separately) of mortgage debt. As background, for tax years prior to 2018, an itemized tax deduction was allowed for interest paid on the first $1 million of mortgage debt&nbsp;(or the first $500,000 for married individuals filing separately).This section also allows certain mortgage insurance premiums to be included in the itemized tax deduction for home mortgage interest.(Sec. 70109) This section makes permanent a provision that limits the itemized tax deduction for unreimbursed personal casualty losses to such losses associated with a federally declared disaster. (As background, for tax years before 2018, the itemized tax deduction for unreimbursed personal casualty and theft losses was not restricted to such losses associated with a federally declared disaster.)However, this section also expands the itemized tax deduction to include unreimbursed personal casualty losses attributable to certain state declared disasters.(Sec. 70110) This section permanently eliminates the itemized tax deduction for most miscellaneous expenses.&nbsp;However, under this section, an itemized tax deduction for miscellaneous expenses is allowed for&nbsp;certain unreimbursed expenses incurred by teachers and other school personnel.

(Prior to 2018, employees could exclude reimbursements of up to $20 per month paid by an employer for qualified bicycle expenses as a qualified transportation fringe benefit. The exclusion from gross income for qualified bicycle expenses was temporarily eliminated for 2018-2025 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.)(Sec. 70113) This section permanently eliminates for most individuals the above-the-line tax deduction for moving expenses incurred to begin working in a new location. However, under this section, the tax deduction for moving expenses incurred to begin working in a new location is retained for certain active-duty members of the Armed Forces and expanded to include certain members of the intelligence community. (As background, prior to 2018, an above-the-line tax deduction was allowed for reasonable moving expenses incurred by an employee or self-employed individual to begin working in a new location if certain requirements are met. The tax deduction for reasonable moving expenses was eliminated through 2025, by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for individuals other than for certain members of the Armed Forces.)(Sec. 70114) This section makes permanent and further expands the limit on the itemized tax deduction for wagering losses.&nbsp;Specifically, under this section, wagering losses permanently includes expenses incurred in carrying on wagering transactions that would otherwise be deductible (e.g., travel to and from a casino). Thus, expenses incurred in carrying on wagering transactions may be deducted only to the extent that such expenses (in addition to any other wagering losses) are offset by gains from wagering that are included in gross income. &nbsp;&nbsp;This section further limits the tax deduction for wagering losses to 90% (from 100%) of the amount of wagering gains included in gross income. &nbsp;(Sec. 70115) This section permanently allows the designated beneficiary of an Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) account to make additional contributions to their ABLE account (subject to certain requirements and limitations) that are subject to an increased&nbsp;contribution limit.This section also increases the contribution limit to an ABLE account by adding one additional year to the annual adjustment for the cost of living.(Sec. 70116) This section permanently extends the qualified retirement savings contribution tax credit for contributions made to an ABLE account by the account’s designated beneficiary. Further, this section increases the maximum amount of the tax credit to $2,100 (from $2,000). &nbsp;(Sec. 70117) This section makes permanent the provision that allows nontaxable rollovers from a qualified tuition program (529 plan) to an ABLE account, subject to certain requirements.&nbsp;(Sec. 70118) This section permanently treats a qualified hazardous duty area as a combat zone for purposes of determining eligibility for certain federal tax benefits available to members of the Armed Forces. (As background, multiple federal tax benefits are available to members of the&nbsp;Armed Forces serving in a combat zone, including an exclusion from gross income of certain military pay, an extension of time to file income tax returns, and special estate tax rules.) &nbsp;This section also makes permanent the designation of the Sinai Peninsula as a hazardous duty area and expands such designation to include&nbsp;Kenya, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Chad.(Sec. 70119) This section extends the exclusion from gross income for the discharge of student loan debt due to the death or total and permanent disability of the student. However, under this section, the student must provide a work-eligible Social Security number to be eligible for the exclusion.(Sec. 70120) This section temporarily increases the limit on the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes (commonly known as the SALT deduction cap) and&nbsp;phases out the tax deduction for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income exceeding a certain threshold amount.Specifically, the SALT deduction cap increases in 2025 to $40,000 from $10,000 (or to $20,000 from $5,000 for married individuals filing separately). The SALT deduction cap increases in 2026 to $40,400 ( $20,200 for married individuals filing separately) and, then, by 1% each year after 2026, through 2029. In 2030, under this section, the SALT deduction cap reverts to $10,000 (or&nbsp;$5,000 for married individuals filing separately).Further, under this section, the amount of state and local taxes allowed as a federal tax deduction is reduced (but not below $10,000 or $5,000 for married individuals filing separately) by 30% of the amount that an individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold amount. The threshold amount in 2025 is $500,000 ( $250,000 for married individuals filing separately). The threshold amount increases in 2026 to $505,000 ($252,500 for married individuals filing separately) and, then, increases by 1% each year after 2026, through 2029.Chapter 2--Delivering on Presidential Priorities to Provide New Middle-Class Tax ReliefThis chapter establishes new tax deductions for qualified tips, qualified overtime, and some interest paid on a passenger vehicle loan. This chapter also establishes a new type of tax-advantaged account, called a Trump account.Below is a summary of the provisions in this chapter.(Sec. 70201) This section establishes a new above-the-line tax deduction, through 2028, of up to $25,000 for qualified tip income, which begins to phase out for individuals whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers). (Above-the-line deductions are subtracted from gross income to calculate adjusted gross income.)To be eligible for the tax deduction for qualified tip income, individuals must provide a work-eligible Social Security number for themselves and, if married, must file a joint federal tax return.(Sec. 70202) This section establishes a new above-the-line tax deduction, through 2028, of up to $12,500 ($25,000 for joint filers) for qualified overtime compensation, which begins to phase out for individuals whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).To be eligible for the tax deduction for qualified tip income, individuals must provide a work-eligible Social Security number for themselves and, if married, must file a joint federal tax return.(Sec. 70203) This section establishes a new tax deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on indebtedness incurred in 2025 through 2028 to buy a passenger vehicle (for personal use and subject to certain requirements). The tax deduction phases out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income that exceeds $100,000 (or $200,000 for joint filers).(Sec. 70204) This section establishes a new type of tax-advantaged account, called a Trump account, which is an individual retirement account (IRA) (but not a Roth IRA) for individuals under 18 years old. Up to $5,000 (adjusted for inflation) may be contributed to a Trump account in each year before the account beneficiary reaches the age of 18 years old. (Certain rollovers and qualified general contributions do not count towards the annual contribution limit.)Distributions from a Trump account may be made once the account beneficiary reaches the age of 18 years old. (Some exceptions apply.)This section also authorizes a one-time federal government deposit of $1,000 into a Trump account for individuals born after December 31, 2024 and before January 1, 2029 (subject to certain other requirements).Chapter 3--Establishing Certainty and Competitiveness for American Job CreatorsSubchapter A--Permanent U.S. Business Tax Reforms and Boosting Domestic InvestmentThis subchapter makes a number of changes to business-related federal tax provisions.Below is a summary of provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70301) This section permanently extends 100% bonus depreciation for property acquired and placed into service (and for certain plants planted or grafted) on or after January 19, 2025. (Bonus depreciation generally allows a business to deduct either the full cost or a large percentage of the cost of qualified property in the year that the property is placed into service, rather than depreciating such costs over a period of time.)(Sec. 70302) This section allows taxpayers to deduct domestic research and experimental expenses in the year such expenses are incurred (rather than requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenses over 5 years or, if elected, over 10 years). However, under this section, taxpayers must continue to capitalize and amortize over a 15-year period foreign research and experimental expenses.Under this section, taxpayers may elect to capitalize and amortize over at least 60 months domestic research and experimental expenses. (Some exclusions apply.)Further, under this section (1) small business taxpayers (with average annual gross receipts of $31 million or less) may claim a tax deduction for domestic research and experimental expenses retroactively to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, and (2) taxpayers may elect to accelerate amortization attributable to domestic research and experimental expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 2021 and before January 1, 2025.(Sec. 70303) This section reinstates the exclusion of the tax deduction for depreciation, amortization, or depletion from the calculation of adjusted taxable income for purposes of the limitation on the tax deduction for interest expenses for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.This section also expands the exclusion of interest on floor plan financing from the limit on the tax deduction for business interest expenses to include interest on floor plan financing of any camper or trailer designed to (1) provide temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, or seasonal use; and (2) be towed by, or affixed to, a motor vehicle.(Sec. 70304) This section makes permanent the business tax credit for paid family and medical leave and allows employers to base the tax credit on certain wages or premiums paid.Specifically, under this section, an eligible employer may claim a tax credit beginning in 2026, as part of the general business tax credit, for up to 25% of either (1) wages paid to qualifying employees during any period that such employees are on family and medical leave, or (2) the total amount of premiums paid or incurred for insurance policies that provide paid family and medical leave for employees. (As background, for 2018-2025, an eligible employer may claim a tax credit as part of the general business tax credit for up to 25% of wages paid to qualifying employees during any period that such employees are on family and medical leave.)(Sec. 70305) This section provides multiple exceptions to the limitation imposed on the tax deduction for employer-provided meals.&nbsp;Specifically, an employer generally may not deduct certain expenses paid or incurred after 2025 for (1) providing food or beverages to employees through an eating facility (operated by the employer for employees) that meets the de&nbsp;minimis requirements for fringe benefits (e.g., office snacks and coffee), or (2) meals provided by the employer for the convenience of the employer on the employer’s premises to employees and their spouses and dependents. (As background, de minimis fringe benefits are benefits that are so small as to make accounting for them unreasonable or impractical.)However, under this section, an employer may continue to deduct such expenses ifsold to customers (including employees) for adequate and full consideration,required to be provided under federal law by the employer to the crew of a commercial vessel,provided by the employer to the crew of a fishing vessel, orprovided to employees of certain fishing processing facilities in Alaska that are not located in a metropolitan area.(Sec. 70306) This section increases to $2.5 million (from $1.25 million in 2025 and adjusted annually for inflation) the maximum amount that may be deducted (expensed) for certain depreciable business assets. This section also increases to $4 million (from $3.13 million in 2025 and adjusted annually for inflation) the dollar amount at which the tax deduction begins to phase out. Both amounts continue to be annually adjusted for inflation.(Sec. 70307) This section provides for an elective 100% depreciation allowance for nonresidential real property that is placed into service before January 1, 2031, and that meets certain other requirements. (Some limitations apply.)(Sec. 70308) This section increases the advance manufacturing tax credit to 35% (from 25%) for property placed into service after December 31, 2025.(Sec. 70309) This section expands the exclusion from gross income for interest on certain bonds issued by state or local governments (specifically tax-exempt facility bonds) to include interest on bonds for which at least 95% of the net proceeds are used to finance a spaceport. (Thus, spaceports are treated in the same manner as airports for purposed of the federal tax-exempt facility bond rules.)Under this section, a spaceport is defined as any facility located at or in close proximity to a launch site or reentry site used formanufacturing, assembling, or repairing spacecraft, space cargo;flight control operations;providing launch services and reentry services; ortransferring crew, spaceflight participants, or space cargo to or from spacecraft.Further, this section provides that a tax-exempt facility bond is not considered federally guaranteed because an agency of the U.S. government is paying rent, fees, or charges for the use of the spaceport. (As background, state and local bonds that are federally guaranteed are not tax-exempt unless an exception applies.)Subchapter B--Permanent America-First International Tax ReformsPart I--Foreign Tax CreditThis part makes multiple changes to the foreign tax credit.Below is a summary of the provisions in this part.(Sec. 70311) This section limits the tax deductions a domestic corporate shareholder may allocate to net CFC tested income (formerly known as global intangible taxable income [GILTI] and renamed under Section 70323 of this act) for purposes of determining the limit on the foreign tax credit.&nbsp;(In this context, CFC refers to controlled foreign corporation.)Specifically, under this section, a domestic corporation may allocate to net CFC tested income (1) the tax deduction for 40% of the net CFC tested income amount included by such corporation in gross income and amounts treated as dividends attributable to such amounts, and (2) any other deduction directly allocable to such income.Further, under this section, interest expenses and research and development expenses paid by a domestic corporate shareholder may not be apportioned to net CFC tested income.(Sec. 70312) This section increases the tax credit allowed to a domestic corporation for income taxes paid by a controlled foreign corporation attributable to income included by the corporation as subpart F income and net CFC tested income (formerly known as GILTI and renamed under Section 70323 of this act).&nbsp;Under this section, for tax years beginning in 2026, a domestic corporation is allowed a foreign tax credit of up to 90% of the foreign income taxes that are paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation of which the domestic corporation is a shareholder and that are attributable to CFC tested income. (For tax years beginning before 2026, a domestic corporation generally is allowed a foreign tax credit of up to 80% of such foreign income taxes paid or accrued.)&nbsp;As background, the allowance of a tax credit for only a percentage of the foreign taxes paid or accrued on net CFC tested income is also known as the foreign tax credit haircut. Thus, under this section, the foreign tax credit haircut is decreased to 10% (from 20%).This section also applies the 10% foreign tax credit haircut to foreign income taxes paid or accrued on &nbsp;distributions of previously taxed net CFC tested income.(Sec. 70313) This section allows a percentage of the income from the sale of certain inventory to be treated as foreign-sourced income for purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit.Specifically, under this section, a U.S. person may treat as foreign-sourced income up to 50% of the income from the sale of inventory produced in the United States (for use outside of the United States) that is attributable to a foreign office or fixed place of business outside of the United States.&nbsp;Part II--Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income and Net&nbsp;CFC Tested IncomeThis part makes multiple changes to the tax deduction allowed to a domestic corporation for foreign-derived intangible income and GILTI.Below is a summary of the provisions in the part.(Sec. 70321) This section increases the tax deduction allowed to a domestic corporation for foreign-derived deduction eligible income (formerly known as foreign-derived intangible income and renamed under Section 70323 of this act)&nbsp;and net CFC tested income (formerly known as GILTI and renamed under Section 70323 of this act).Under this section, for tax years beginning in 2026, a domestic corporation generally may claim a tax deduction equal to the sum of (1) 33.34% of such corporation’s foreign-derived deduction eligible income, and (2) 40% of such corporation’s net CFC tested income.As background, for tax years beginning after 2017 and before 2026,&nbsp;a domestic corporation generally is allowed a tax deduction equal to the sum of (1) 37.5% of such corporation’s foreign-derived intangible income, and (2) 50% of such corporation’s GILTI. As enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and prior to modification by this section, the deduction decreased starting in 2026, to the sum of (1) 21.875% of such corporation’s foreign-derived intangible income, and (2) 37.5% of such corporation’s GILTI and amounts treated as dividends attributable to such amounts.(Sec. 70322) This section excludes gain from the sale or disposition of certain property&nbsp;from the calculation of the tax deduction for foreign-derived deduction eligible income.Specifically, under this section, deduction eligible income (for purposes of the tax deduction for foreign-derived deduction eligible income) may not include&nbsp;gain from the sale or other disposition (including the deemed sale or other disposition) occurring after June 16, 2025, of (1) property of a type that gives rise to rents or royalties, and (2) any other property that is subject to depreciation, amortization, or depletion by the seller of such property.Further, under this section, deduction&nbsp;eligible income must be reduced by expenses and deductions directly related to such income.(Sec. 70323) This section eliminates the use of a domestic corporation’s deemed tangible income return in determining foreign-derived intangible income and such corporation’s net deemed tangible income return in determining GILTI. As a result, under this section, the term foreign-derived intangible income is renamed foreign-derived deduction eligible income and the term GILTI is renamed net CFC tested income.Part III--Base Erosion Minimum TaxThis part makes changes to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT).Below is a summary of the provision in this part.(Sec. 70331) This section decreases the BEAT rate to 10.5% (from 12.5%) for tax years beginning after 2025. (Prior to amendment by this section, the BEAT rate wass 10% for 2025 and 12.5% for tax years after 2025.)Part IV--Business Interest LimitationThis part makes changes to the calculation of the limitation on the tax deduction of business interest expenses. Under current law, the tax deduction for business interest expenses is limited to the sum of (1) business interest income for the tax year in which the tax deduction is being claimed, (2) 30% of the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income, and (3) the taxpayer’s floor plan financing interest.Below is a summary of the provisions in this part.(Sec. 70341) This section provides that the&nbsp;limitation on tax deduction of business interest is calculated before capitalizable interest is calculated. (Some exceptions apply.)(Sec. 70342) This section excludes subpart F income and net CFC tested income (formerly known as GILTI and renamed under section 70323 of this act) from adjusted taxable income for purposes of calculating limitation on tax deduction of business interest.Part V--Other International Tax ReformsThis part makes permanent and modifies multiple federal tax provisions that impact foreign corporations.Below is a summary of the key provisions in this part.(Sec. 70351) This section permanently extends the CFC look-through rule. (Under the CFC look-through rule, certain interest expenses, dividends, rents, and royalties received by one CFC from a related CFC are not treated as foreign personal holding company income [for purposes of calculating subpart F income] if certain other requirements are met.)(Sec. 70352) This section requires a specified foreign corporation (generally a CFC or any foreign corporation with respect to which one or more domestic corporations is a U.S. shareholder) to use the taxable year of their majority U.S. shareholder , effective for tax years beginning after November 30, 2025. (For tax years beginning on or before November 30, 2025, a specified foreign corporation may elect a tax year beginning one month earlier than the majority U.S. shareholder.)Chapter 4--Investing in American Families, Communities, and Small BusinessesSubchapter A--Permanent Investments in Families and ChildrenThis subchapter makes multiple changes to federal tax provisions related to children and dependents.Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70401) This section increases the tax credit for employers that provide child care to their employees. Under this section, the portion of the tax credit for qualified child care expenses increases to 40% (from 25%) or to 50% for eligible small businesses. This section also increases the maximum amount of the tax credit to $500,000 (from $150,000) or $600,000 for eligible small businesses (adjusted for inflation).(Sec. 70402) This section makes up to $5,000 of the adoption tax credit refundable and adjusts this amount annually for inflation after 2025. However, under this section, the refundable portion of the adoption tax credit may not be carried forward. (Under current law, the amount of the allowed adoption tax credit that exceeds an individual’s tax liability may be carried forward for up to five years.)(Sec. 70403) This section allows Indian tribal governments to determine whether a child has special needs for purposes of calculating the adoption tax credit.(Sec. 70404) This section increases to $7,500 (or $3,750 for a married individual filing separately) from $5,000 (or $2,500 for a married person filing separately) the exclusion from gross income for amounts paid or incurred by an employer to an employee as part of a dependent care assistance program.(Sec. 70405) This section increases the non-refundable tax credit for expenses paid by an individual for the care of a child or dependent that enable such individual to be gainfully employed.&nbsp;Subchapter B--Permanent Investments in Students and Reforms to Tax-Exempt InstitutionsThis subchapter makes multiple changes to federal tax provisions related to education and certain educational institutions.Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70411) This section establishes a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $1,700 for cash contributions made by an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States to a tax-exempt organization that provides scholarships for qualified elementary and secondary school expenses to eligible students (scholarship granting organization), subject to limitations.(Sec. 70412) This section makes permanent the exclusion of education assistance paid by an employer to an employee (up to a maximum amount) from (1) gross income by an employee, and (2) wages by an employer (for employment tax purposes). Further, under this section, the maximum amount ($5,250 for 2025 and 2026) of employer-paid education assistance that may be excluded from gross income and wages is adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2027.(Sec. 70413) This section expands the expenses eligible for tax-free withdrawals from qualified tuition programs (529 plans) to include certain additional expenses related to enrollment or attendance at an&nbsp;elementary or secondary school.&nbsp;This section also increases to $20,000 (from $10,000) the limit on distributions from a 529 plan used in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary school.(Sec. 70414) This section expands the expenses eligible for tax-free withdrawals from 529 plans to include tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and other expenses related to the enrollment or attendance in a recognized postsecondary credentialing program.(Sec. 70415) This section replaces the excise tax of 1.4% imposed on the net investment income of certain private university and college endowments with a new rate structure of 1.4%, 4%, or 8%, depending on several variables including the value of the endowment and the number of full-time students who meet certain other requirements.(Sec. 70416) This section expands the excise tax imposed on certain tax-exempt organizations for excess compensation paid to certain employees (an employee who is one of the top five highest compensated employees of such organization) to include excess compensation paid to any employee of such organization. (Thus, a tax-exempt organization is liable for an excise equal to the corporate tax rate [21%] multiplied by the sum of remuneration in excess of $1 million and excess parachute payment paid to any employee by the tax-exempt organization.)Subchapter C--Permanent Investments in Community DevelopmentThis subchapter makes multiple changes to certain federal tax incentives related to investing in certain communities and tax deductions for charitable contributions.Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70421) This section permanently extends the Opportunity Zone program, establishes specific tax incentives for investments in rural areas, and modifies the rules related to deferred gains and stepped-up basis.As background, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act temporarily authorized tax incentives for investments (made through qualified opportunity funds) in designated economically distressed areas (called qualified opportunity zones). Specifically, qualified opportunity fund investors may (1) defer capital gain if such gain is reinvested in a qualified opportunity fund within 180 days, (2) exclude from gross income all (or part) of the capital gains from qualified opportunity fund investments held for a certain period of time, and (3) receive a step up in basis (value of the capital asset when it is sold) of 10% for qualified opportunity fund investments held for at least five years and an additional 5% for qualified opportunity fund investments held for at least seven years. (An increase in the basis of a capital asset generally lowers the taxable amount of such asset.)Under this section, capital gains from qualified opportunity fund investments made beginning in 2027, may be deferred to the earlier of the date on which such investment is sold or exchanged or five years after the date on which the investment is made. (Capital gain from qualified opportunity investments made before 2027, may be deferred to the earlier of the date on which such investment is sold or exchanged or December 31, 2026. (Thus, this section establishes a rolling five-year deferral for capital gains from qualified opportunity funds.)This section also eliminates the additional 5% step up in basis for qualified opportunity zone fund investments held for at least 7 years, but increases the basis for such investments held for at least 10 years to the fair market value of the investment.&nbsp;Finally, this section establishes qualified rural opportunity funds for investments in rural areas. Investors in qualified rural opportunity funds may be eligible for a 30% step up in basis if certain requirements are met.(Sec. 70422) This section increases eligibility for the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) by increasing the amount that a state may allocate for the LIHTC and reducing the tax-exempt bond financing threshold.As background, a taxpayer may claim the LIHTC for expenses incurred to rehabilitate or build rental housing for low-income tenants (1) if an allocation for the LIHTC is received from the state, or (2) a percentage of the project is financed by certain tax-exempt bonds. The amount a state may allocate for the LIHTC is calculated, in part, by multiplying a certain dollar amount (adjusted annually for inflation) by the state’s population.&nbsp;Under this section, beginning in 2026, the portion of the federal allocation to each state for the LIHTC that is based on the state’s population is increased by 12%.Further, this section lowers to 25% (from 50%) the tax-exempt bond threshold. Thus, under this section, if 25% or more of the aggregate basis (i.e., generally the costs) of the building and the land on which the building is located is financed with tax-exempt bonds, then the taxpayer is eligible for the LIHTC for the entire eligible basis of the project without a LIHTC allocation from the state. (If less than 25% of such basis is financed with tax-exempt bonds, then only the basis of the project that is financed with the tax-exempt bonds is eligible for the LIHTC.)(Sec. 70423) This section permanently extends the New Markets Tax Credit (a tax credit for certain investments in eligible, low-income communities).(Sec. 70424) This section makes permanent and increases to $1,000 for single filers (from $300) or $2,000 for joint filers (from $600 for joint filers) the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by individuals who do not itemize their federal income tax deductions.(Sec. 70425) This section imposes a new limitation on the itemized tax deduction for charitable contributions made by individuals beginning in 2026. Under this section, an itemized tax deduction for charitable contributions is allowed only to the extent that an individual’s aggregate charitable contributions exceed 0.5% of the individual’s contribution base (adjusted gross income calculated without including any net operating loss carryback amount). (This limitation is generally known as the 0.5% floor for the itemized tax deduction for individual charitable contributions and does not apply to tax deductions for charitable contributions made by individuals who do not itemize their tax deductions under Section 70424 of this act.)Further, under this section, the 0.5% floor also applies to excess charitable contributions made by individuals in 2026 or after that are carried forward to subsequent tax years. (Excess charitable contributions made prior to 2026 that are carried forward to subsequent tax year are not subject to the 0.5% floor.)&nbsp;(Sec. 70426) This section further limits the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation beginning in 2026. Under this section, a tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation is allowed only to the extent that the corporation’s aggregate charitable contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income. (This limitation is generally known as the 1% floor for the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation.)&nbsp;As a result of the 1% floor imposed by this section and existing limitations, a corporation may deduct charitable contributions only to the extent that such contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income but do not exceed 10% of the corporation’s taxable income (10% limit).Finally, under this section, special rules and limitations also apply to corporate charitable contributions carried forward to subsequent tax years.(Sec. 70427) This section reinstates and makes permanent (beginning in 2026) the $13.25 (currently $10.50) per proof gallon limit on the&nbsp;amount that is transferred by the United States to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for excise taxes collected on distilled spirits (e.g., rum) imported from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.As background, the United States imposes an excise tax of $13.50 per proof gallon on distilled spirits produced in or imported into the United States. A certain amount of the excise tax collected on distilled spirits imported from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are transferred back into the treasury of each possession. (This transfer is commonly known as the cover over or the rum cover over.) For 2022-2026, the rum cover over amount is limited to $10.50 per proof gallon. An additional rum cover over in the amount of $2.75 (for a total rum cover over of $13.25) authorized by Congress expired at the end of 2021.(Sec. 70428) This section treats participation or investment in fisheries (e.g., harvesting, processing, transportation, sales, and marketing of fish and fish products) in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands by certain tax-exempt Alaskan villages as substantially related to the village’s tax-exempt purpose and, thus, income gained from such activities remains tax-exempt.(Sec. 70429) This section increases to $50,000 (from $10,000) the limit on the tax deduction for &nbsp;expenses incurred by a whaling captain (as recognized by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission) in carrying out sanctioned bowhead whaling activities.(Sec. 70430) This section allows certain residential construction contracts entered into in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, to use another permissible method of accounting (e.g., the uniform capitalization rules), rather than the percentage&nbsp;of&nbsp;completion method of accounting. (The percentage of completion method of accounting or the percentage of completion-capitalized cost accounting method of accounting is used for residential construction contracts that are not home construction contracts and that are entered into in tax years beginning on or before July 4, 2025.)Subchapter D--Permanent Investments in Small Business and Rural AmericaThis subchapter modifies certain reporting requirements related to third-party settlement organizations and makes changes to several other federal tax provisions.Below is a summary of the key provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70432) This section modifies the reporting requirements applicable to third-party settlement organizations (e.g., certain online platforms, apps, and card payment processors). Under this section, such organizations are required to issue Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $20,000 from more than 200 separate transactions. (This section reverses a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that lowered the reporting threshold to $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions, the implementation of which was delayed and phased in by the IRS. For 2025, under current law, such organizations are required to issue IRS Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $2,500, regardless of the number of transactions.)(Sec. 70434) This section expands the federal tax deduction for certain film, television, and theatrical production costs to allow a deduction of up to $150,000 of qualified sound recording production costs in the tax year such costs are incurred. A qualified sound recording production is a sound recording that is produced and recorded in the United States. (Under current law, up to $20 million of film, television, and theatrical production costs incurred before 2026 may be deducted.)The section also extends bonus depreciation to qualified sound recording production costs.(Sec. 70436) This section eliminates the $200 excise tax imposed on the transfer of certain firearms other than machine guns and destructive devices&nbsp;(e.g., bombs, grenades, certain rockets, missiles, and mines). As a result, the $200 excise tax is not applicable to silencers, short-barreled rifles and short-barreled shotguns.Chapter 5--Ending Green New Deal Spending, Promoting America-First Energy and Other ReformsSubchapter A--Termination of Green New Deal SubsidiesThis subchapter terminates multiple energy-related federal tax credits.Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70501) This section terminates the previously-owned clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $4,000 for the purchase of a qualified previously-owned clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)(Sec. 70502) This section terminates the clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a qualified new clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)(Sec. 70503) This section terminates the qualified commercial clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, businesses may claim a tax credit of up to $40,000 for the purchase of a commercial clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)(Sec. 70504) This section terminates the alternative fuel refueling property tax credit. (Thus, a tax credit of up to $1,000 for individuals or up to $100,000 for businesses is allowed for the installation of property before July 1, 2026, that is used to store or dispense clean-burning fuel or to recharge electric vehicles.)(Sec. 70505) This section terminates the energy efficient home improvement tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $3,200, for certain energy-efficient property purchased and installed into a primary residence before&nbsp;2026.)(Sec. 70506) This section terminates the residential clean energy tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit for certain renewable energy equipment for a principal residence before&nbsp;2026.)(Sec. 70507) This section terminates the energy efficient commercial buildings tax deduction. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a deduction for certain energy efficient commercial property the construction of which begins before July 1, 2027.)(Sec. 70508) This section terminates the new energy efficient home tax credit. (Thus, contractors may claim a business tax credit for constructing an energy-efficient home that is acquired by a person for use as a residence before July 1, 2026.)(Sec. 70509) This section terminates the special five-year cost recovery period for investments in certain solar and wind property for which construction begins after December 31, 2024.&nbsp;As background, costs of property used in a trade or business to produce income generally are capitalized and then depreciated or amortized over a period of time (known as the cost recovery period). The cost recovery period for property used to produce electricity generally depends on the method for producing such electricity. However, for certain solar and wind property for which construction begins on or before December 31, 2024, the cost recovery period is five years. For solar and wind property for which construction begins after December 31, 2024, the general modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) and Internal Revenue Service guidance apply.(Sec. 70510) This section disallows the zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities). (The zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit generally is allowed for electricity produced at a qualified nuclear power facility and sold to an unrelated third person.)(Sec. 70511) This section terminates the clean hydrogen production tax credit in 2028 and, thus, the tax credit is allowed only for clean hydrogen production facilities for which construction begins before January 1, 2028. (As background, prior to changes made by this section, the tax credit is available for the production of clean hydrogen by a qualifying facility for which construction begins before 2033.)(Sec. 70512) This section terminates the clean electricity production tax credit for (1) wind and solar facilities placed into service after December 31, 2027, and (2) certain wind energy property or solar water heating property if such property is leased to a third party during the tax year. (As background, a tax credit is allowed, other than as provided by this section and subject to limitations, for clean electricity produced by a qualified facility. The tax credit is phased out beginning in the later of 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity are reduced to a certain level.) &nbsp;This section also disallows the clean electricity production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).&nbsp;Further, under this section, penalties may be imposed for (1) substantial misstatements of a certain amount related to the supply chain of manufactured products and product components for which the clean electricity production tax credit is claimed, and (2) overstating depreciable assets to claim the clean energy production tax credit. (Under this act, such penalties are also applicable to the clean electricity investment tax credit and the advanced manufacturing production tax credit.)(Sec. 70513) This section terminates the clean electricity investment credit for (1) wind and solar property, other than energy storage technology, placed into service after December 31, 2027; and (2) certain wind energy property, solar electric property, and solar water heating property if such property is leased to a third party during the tax year. (As background, a tax credit is allowed, other than as provided by this section and subject to limitations, for certain investments in energy storage technology &nbsp;or a facility that is used for generating electricity with an anticipated greenhouse gas admission rate of not greater than zero.)Under this section, the clean electricity production tax credit is not allowed for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).&nbsp;This section also sets the clean electricity production tax credit percentage to 30% (which may not be increased) for qualified fuel cell property for which construction begins after 2025. (As background, the clean electricity production tax credit is 6%, but may be increased to 30% if certain requirements are met, and further increased for property that is placed into service in certain locations, that meets certain construction requirements, or for which an allocation is received from the Clean Electricity Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Amount Program.)(Sec. 70514) This section terminates the advanced manufacturing production credit for wind energy components produced and sold after 2027, and for metallurgical coal (i.e., coking coal or coal used to manufacture steel) produced after 2029. This section also phases out the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for other critical minerals produced after 2030, as follows:75% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2031,50% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2032,24% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2033, and0% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2034.Under this section, the advanced manufacturing production tax credit is not allowed for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).(Sec. 70515) This section provides that the Department of the Treasury may not reallocate amounts that are (1) allocated for the qualified advanced energy projects tax credit, and (2) subsequently revoked. (As background, the Treasury may allocate up to $10 billion [in the form of a tax credit] to taxpayers for approved investments in certain advanced energy projects, subject to certain conditions and limitations. An allocation of the tax credit may be revoked if the project is not completed on time or certain other requirements are not met.)&nbsp;Subchapter B--Enhancement of America-First Energy PolicyThis subchapter modifies multiple energy-related federal tax provisions and makes changes to the calculation of the corporate alternative minimum tax.Below&nbsp;is a summary of the key provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70521) This section extends the clean fuel production tax credit through 2029 andrequires that clean fuels produced from feedstock use feedstock sourced from the Unites States, Canada, or Mexico;excludes emissions attributable to an indirect land use change from the calculation of lifecycle emissions estimates (used in part of the calculation of the clean fuel production tax credit); andrequires the Department of the Treasury to provide distinct emission rates for specific&nbsp;feedstocks used to produce clean fuels, including dairy manure, swine manure, and poultry manure.This section also disallows the clean fuel production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).(Sec. 70522) This section increases the carbon oxide sequestration tax credit to $17 (from $12) per metric ton for qualified carbon dioxide used (1) as a tertiary injectant in a qualified oil or gas natural recovery project and then securely stored or (2) by fixing such carbon dioxide through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, chemical conversion, or for some other commercial market purpose. (As a result, the same carbon oxide sequestration tax credit applies to carbon oxide captured and sequestered and carbon dioxide captured, used, and then sequestered.)This section also disallows the carbon oxide sequestration tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).(Sec. 70523) This section allows corporations to reduce their adjusted financial statement income (for purposes of calculating the corporate alternative minimum tax) to account for certain intangible costs related to oil, gas, or geothermal well drilling and development.(Sec. 70525) This section provides for a refund of previously imposed and paid excise taxes upon the transfer of nontaxable, indelibly dyed diesel fuel or kerosene used for agricultural, off-road, or other nontaxable purposes.Subchapter C--Other ReformsThis subchapter eliminates the de minimis exemption for certain imports into the United States and establishes a new civil penalty for using such exemption in a manner that violates U.S. customs laws.Below is a summary of the provision in this subchapter.(Sec. 70531) This section eliminates the exemption from certain duties, fees, and&nbsp;processes for imports of up to $800 (commonly referred to as the de minimis exemption), effective July 1, 2027.Further, this section establishes a civil penalty for entering, introducing, facilitating, or attempting to introduce an article into the United States using the de minimis exemption in a manner that violates U.S. customs laws. The amount of the civil penalty is up to $5,000 for the first violation and up to $10,000 for subsequent violations.Chapter 6--Enhancing Deduction and Income Tax Credit Guardrails, and Other ReformsThis chapter modifies various federal tax deductions and credits.Below is a summary of the key provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 70604) This section establishes a 1% excise tax on transfers of payments from one country to another (also known as remittance transfers). The excise tax is imposed on the sender of the remittance transfer and collected and remitted to the Department of the Treasury (quarterly) by the transfer provider.&nbsp;Under this section, the excise tax applies only to remittance transfers for which the sender provides cash, a money order, a cashier’s check, or other similar physical instrument to the transfer provider. The excise tax does not apply to remittance transfers if (1) the funds are withdrawn from an account held at certain financial institutions, or (2) funded with a debit card or credit card issued in the United States.(Sec. 70606) This section requires an individual to provide a Social Security number to be eligible for the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits.(Sec. 70607) This section directs the Internal Revenue Service to deliver a report to Congress on tax filing programs. Specificallythe cost of enhancing and establishing public-private partnerships that provide for free tax filing for up to 70% of all taxpayers (calculated by adjusted gross income),the cost to replace any direct e-file programs run by the Internal Revenue Service,taxpayer opinions and preferences regarding a taxpayer-funded, government-run tax filing service or a free tax filing service provided by the private sector,assessment of the feasibility of providing simple and consistent options across participating tax filing providers, andthe cost of developing and running a free direct&nbsp;e-file tax return system..Subtitle B--HealthChapter 1--MedicaidSubchapter A--Reducing Fraud and Improving Enrollment Processes(Sec. 71101) This section delays until FY2035 implementation of certain provisions of the rule titled Streamlining Medicaid; Medicare Savings Program Eligibility Determination and Enrollment, which was issued by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) on September 21, 2023.&nbsp;Specifically, the section delays provisions of the rule that (1) specify that individuals who must pay a premium to enroll in Medicare hospital services, reside in a group payer state, and enroll during a general enrollment period may qualify for Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs) as early as the month of their entitlement to Medicare hospital services; (2) require states to use certain data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to facilitate the enrollment of qualifying individuals in both MSPs and the Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) program under the Medicare prescription drug benefit; and (3) align the definition of family size under MSPs with the definition under the LIS program.(MSPs allow individuals to receive Medicare cost-sharing and premium assistance from state Medicaid programs if they meet certain income and resource criteria. The LIS program, also known as the Extra Help program, provides similar assistance with respect to cost-sharing for covered drugs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit.)The section provides $1 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement this section and Sec. 71102 of this act.(Sec. 71102) This section delays until FY2035 implementation of certain provisions of the rule titled Medicaid Program; Streamlining the Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, and Basic Health Program Application, Eligibility Determination, Enrollment, and Renewal Processes, which was issued by the&nbsp;CMS on April 2, 2024.Specifically, the section delays provisions of the rule that, among other changes, (1) allow state Medicaid programs to verify an individual’s U.S. citizenship and identity through certain systems without additional proof of identity; (2) align certain Medicaid enrollment processes for those whose eligibility is not based on income with those that are based on income; and (3) establish additional timelines for Medicaid eligibility terminations, including when there is a change in an individual’s circumstances.(Sec. 71103) This section requires the CMS to establish a centralized system for states to check whether enrollees are simultaneously enrolled in Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in multiple states.&nbsp;Beginning no later than 2027, states must regularly obtain the addresses of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees from specified authorized sources. Beginning no later than FY2030, states must report on at least a monthly basis the Social Security numbers of enrollees to the CMS' newly established system. The CMS must notify states on at least a monthly basis of individuals who are enrolled in multiple states so that states may take appropriate action.The section provides $10 million for FY2026 and $20 million for FY2029 for the CMS to establish and maintain the new system, respectively.(Sec. 71104) This section requires state Medicaid programs to check, beginning in 2028, the SSA's Death Master File on at least a quarterly basis to determine whether Medicaid enrollees are deceased.(Sec. 71105) This section provides statutory authority for the requirement that state Medicaid programs check, as part of the provider enrollment and reenrollment process, whether providers are deceased through the SSA's Death Master File. Beginning in 2028, the section requires states to continue to check this database on at least a quarterly basis after providers are enrolled.(Sec. 71106) This section includes Medicaid payments to individuals for whom there is insufficient information as to their eligibility as erroneous excess payments that may ultimately reduce a state’s federal matching funds. These changes apply beginning in FY2030.(Sec. 71107) This section requires state Medicaid programs to redetermine every six months, beginning with the first quarter after December 31, 2026, the eligibility of individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (That act allows states to extend Medicaid coverage to all adults under the age of 65 with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, including able-bodied adults without dependent children.)The section provides $75 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71108) This section caps home equity limits for Medicaid nursing facility or other long-term care services beginning in 2028.Currently, in order to qualify for such services, an individual’s home equity may not exceed certain limits, as set by states in accordance with federal standards and adjusted annually for inflation. For 2025, home equity limits set by states must be between $730,000 and $1,097,000.The section caps the maximum home equity limit to $1 million, regardless of inflation. This limit does not apply to homes located on agricultural lots.(Sec. 71109) This section generally restricts, beginning in FY2027, federal payment for Medicaid and CHIP to services for individuals who are U.S. residents and are either U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban-Haitian entrants, or Compact of Free Association migrants lawfully residing in the United States. The restrictions do not apply to certain mandatory emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States or to optional services provided to certain lawfully residing children and pregnant women.Current law authorizes federal payment with respect to additional categories of individuals, including refugees; noncitizens granted parole for at least one year, asylum, or related relief; and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioners. The section excludes these individuals from eligibility.&nbsp;The section provides $15 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71110) This section reduces the Medicaid federal matching rate for emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States but who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population in states that have expanded Medicaid. Specifically, the section limits, beginning in FY2027, the Medicaid federal matching rate for emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States to the same matching rate as would otherwise apply for such services (rather than the enhanced federal matching rate for states that have expanded Medicaid).The section provides $1 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.Subchapter B--Preventing Wasteful Spending(Sec. 71111) This section delays until FY2035 implementation of certain provisions of the rule titled Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting, which was issued by the CMS on May 10, 2024.&nbsp;Specifically, the section delays provisions of the rule that, among other changes, (1) establish minimum staffing standards for nurses in Medicare and Medicaid long-term care facilities, including requiring a nurse to be onsite 24/7 and requiring a minimum of 3.48 total nurse staffing hours per resident per day; and (2) require state Medicaid programs to report on payments to direct care workers and support staff of nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.&nbsp;(Sec. 71112) This section shortens the window for retroactive Medicaid coverage. Specifically, the section specifies that, beginning with the first quarter after December 31, 2026, Medicaid coverage may begin retroactively (1) for individuals in the Medicaid expansion population, one month prior to the application filing date; and (2) for all other individuals, two months prior to the application filing date. Additionally, CHIP coverage may retroactively begin two months prior to the application filing date. (Currently, coverage may begin three months prior to the application filing date.)The section provides $10 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71113) This section prohibits federal Medicaid payment for one year to nonprofit health care providers that serve predominantly low-income, medically underserved individuals (i.e., essential community providers) if the provider (1) primarily furnishes family planning services, reproductive health, and related care; (2) offers abortions in cases other than that of rape, incest, or life-threatening conditions for the woman; and (3) in FY2023, received federal and state Medicaid payments totaling more than $800,000.The section provides $1 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.Subchapter C--Stopping Abusive Financing Practices(Sec. 71114) This section requires states that had not chosen to expand Medicaid pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act prior to March 11, 2021, to do so by January 1, 2026, in order to receive the corresponding enhanced federal matching rate.(Sec. 71115) This section generally limits Medicaid provider taxes beginning in FY2027.Under current law, states may impose a provider tax of up to 6% of net patient service revenues to potentially receive additional federal matching funds. The section precludes states that have not expanded Medicaid from increasing the rate of a provider tax beyond that currently in effect in order to qualify for federal matching funds. For states that have expanded Medicaid, a provider tax may not exceed the current rate or a specified rate, whichever is lower; the maximum rate gradually decreases from FY2028-FY2032, with a maximum rate of 3.5% beginning in FY2032 (these limits do not apply to nursing and intermediate care facilities, which are instead limited to current rates). The section additionally precludes states from imposing a new provider tax if there is not already one in effect.The section provides $20 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.(Sec. 71116) This section provides $7 million per fiscal year for FY2026-FY2033 for the CMS to revise regulations so as to limit state-directed payments for inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, and qualified practitioner services at an academic medical center under Medicaid managed care contracts to the payment rate for services under Medicare, rather than the average commercial rate. For states that cover the Medicaid expansion population, payment is limited to 100% of the Medicare rate; for other states, payment is limited to 110% of the Medicare rate.Subchapter D--Increasing Personal Accountability(Sec. 71119) This section requires, beginning not later than the first quarter after December 31, 2026 (or earlier, at the option of the state), individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population to engage in community service, work, or other activities in order to qualify for Medicaid.Specifically, the section requires these individuals to, on a monthly basis, (1) work at least 80 hours, (2) complete at least 80 hours of community service, (3) participate in a work program for at least 80 hours, (4) be enrolled at least half-time in an educational program, or (5) engage in any combination thereof for a total of at least 80 hours. Individuals may also qualify if they have a monthly income (or, for seasonal workers, an average monthly income over six months) that is at least as much as the equivalent of minimum wage multiplied by 80 hours.Individuals who are applying for Medicaid must demonstrate compliance with these requirements for one to three months (as determined by the state) consecutively and immediately prior to filing an application; individuals who are already enrolled in Medicaid must demonstrate compliance for one month or more (as determined by the state), whether or not consecutive, during the period between the individual’s last eligibility determination and the next scheduled eligibility determination.&nbsp;States must verify an individual’s compliance upon a determination or redetermination of eligibility but may also choose to verify compliance more frequently. States may not waive the new requirements. However, states may choose to provide an exception for individuals experiencing short-term hardships (e.g., hospitalization).The section excludes certain individuals from these requirements, including those with serious medical conditions or with dependent children aged 13 or younger.&nbsp;Upon request, the CMS may exempt a state from fully implementing these requirements until December 31, 2028. States requesting an exemption must demonstrate good faith efforts to comply with the requirements and provide a detailed timeline for implementation.The section provides $200 million to states and $200 million to the CMS for FY2026 to implement these requirements.(Sec. 71120) This section requires, beginning in FY2029, states to institute cost-sharing requirements for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population and whose family income exceeds the federal poverty line. Cost sharing may not exceed $35 for an item or service; total cost sharing for all individuals in a family may not exceed 5% of the family’s income.&nbsp;The requirements do not apply to (1) services for which cost sharing is already prohibited (e.g., emergency services); (2) primary care, mental health, or substance use disorder services; or (3) services provided by federally qualified health centers, certified community behavioral health clinics, or rural health clinics. States may allow providers to condition the provision of services upon the payment of any required cost sharing.The section provides $15 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.Subchapter E--Expanding Access to Care(Sec. 71121) This section authorizes additional home and community-based services (HCBS) waivers (also known as Section 1915(c) waivers) for state Medicaid programs beginning on July 1, 2028. States may seek waivers to provide HCBS to individuals without the need for certain determinations as to whether an individual requires hospital or institutional care (as is required for current waivers). States must establish other needs-based criteria for such services.The section provides $50 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions. It also provides $100 million for FY2027 to support state HCBS programs.Chapter 2--MedicareSubchapter A--Strengthening Eligibility Requirements(Sec. 71201) This section generally restricts Medicare eligibility to U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban-Haitian entrants, and Compact of Free Association migrants lawfully residing in the United States. The SSA must identify Medicare enrollees who do not meet these requirements and terminate their enrollment within 18 months of this section’s enactment.Current law authorizes additional categories of individuals who are lawfully present in the United States to qualify for Medicare, including refugees; noncitizens granted parole for at least one year, asylum, or related relief; noncitizens with Temporary Protected Status; and noncitizens with deferred action, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. The section excludes these individuals from eligibility.(Sec. 71202) This section increases payments under the Medicare physician fee schedule for services furnished between January 1, 2026, and January 1, 2027.Subchapter B--Improving Services for Seniors(Sec. 71203) This section modifies certain provisions under the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program with respect to orphan drugs, including by excluding additional orphan drugs from qualifying for negotiation.The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program requires the CMS to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs under Medicare beginning in 2026. Among other requirements, drugs must have had market approval for at least 7 years (for drug products) or 11 years (for biologics) to qualify for negotiation. The program does not apply to orphan drugs that are approved to treat only one rare disease or condition.The section modifies these provisions so as to exclude any period in which a drug was an orphan drug from market approval calculations. It also excludes orphan drugs that are approved to treat more than one rare disease or condition from the program. The changes take effect in 2028.Chapter 3--Health TaxSubchapter A-- Improving Eligibility CriteriaThis subchapter modifies eligibility and verification requirements for the premium tax credit (which may be used to purchase health insurance on an exchange).Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 71301) This section limits a lawfully-present alien’s eligibility for the premium tax credit toan alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence;an alien who has been granted the status of Cuban and Haitian entrant; oran individual who is lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and&nbsp;Palau.(Sec. 71302) This section repeals the rule that allows certain lawfully-present aliens who have a household income of less than 100% of the federal poverty level and are ineligible for Medicaid (based on the individual’s alien status) to claim the premium tax credit.Subchapter B--Preventing Waste, Fraud, and AbuseThis subchapter requires verification of certain information supplied by individuals for purposes of determining eligibility for the premium tax credit, limits use of the premium tax credit, and expands recapture of excess advance payments of the premium tax credit.Below is a summary of the provisions of this subchapter.(Sec. 71303) This section requires the verification, beginning in 2028, of certain information for an individual to enroll in a health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange and to generally qualify for the premium tax credit. (Under current law, eligible individuals are allowed a premium tax credit, which applies toward the cost of obtaining health insurance through health insurance exchanges.)Specifically, under this section, a health insurance exchange must verify, using applicable enrollment information provided (or verified) by an individual,&nbsp;the following information:household income and family size,whether the individual is an eligible alien,any health coverage status or eligibility for coverage,place of residence, andany other information required by the Department of the Treasury.The verification requirements may be waived for individuals who enroll in a health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange during a special enrollment period due to a change in family size.(Sec. 71304) This section provides that the premium tax credit is not allowed for any health insurance plan enrolled in through a health insurance exchange during a special enrollment period provided by such exchange (1) on the basis of the relationship between the individual’s expected household income to the federal poverty level, and (2) not in connection with with the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances specified by the Department of Health and Human Services for such purposes.(Sec. 71305) This section eliminates the limit on the recapture of excess advance payments of the premium tax credit and, accordingly, allows the full amount of any such excess payments to be recaptured. (Under current law, individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level may be required to pay back only a portion of any excess advance payment of the premium tax credit.)Subchapter C--Enhancing Choice for PatientsThis subchapter expands health savings account (HSA) eligibility requirements.As background, individuals may establish and contribute to an HSA if they are covered under a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) and not covered under a health plan that (1) is not an HDHP and (2) provides coverage for any benefits that is covered under the HDHP (subject to certain exceptions).Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.(Sec. 71306) This section allows individuals to establish and make tax-deductible contributions to a health savings account (HSA) if covered by a health insurance plan that provides telehealth and other remote care services without requiring a deductible but otherwise meets the requirements of an HDHP.(Sec. 71307) This section expands eligibility to make tax-deductible HSA contributions to include individuals who have a bronze-level or catastrophic health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange.&nbsp;(A bronze-level health insurance plan provided through a health insurance exchange may or may not qualify as a HDHP, depending on the specific plan features. Catastrophic health plans provided through a health insurance exchange generally do not meet the requirements of a HDHP.)(Sec. 71308) This section expands eligibility to make tax-deductible HSA contributions to include individuals who have a direct primary care service arrangement with a fixed period fee that does not exceed $150 a month (or $300 a month if the arrangement covers more than one individual). The amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. (Some limitations apply.)Chapter 4--Protecting Rural Hospitals and Providers(Sec. 71401) This section provides $10 billion per fiscal year for FY2026-FY2030 for a program that supports the provision of health care in rural areas.&nbsp;Under the program, states may apply for financial allotments to improve the access and quality of care of services in rural areas, such as through enhanced technology, strategic partnerships, and workforce training. States must submit detailed rural health transformation plans and certify that no funds will be used to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid or CHIP. The CMS must approve or deny applications by December 31, 2025; states that receive approval do not need to reapply each year. States are not required to contribute any matching funds with respect to program allotments.The CMS must award allotments so that 50% of funds are awarded equally among all approved states. The remaining 50% of funds must be awarded based on certain considerations, including the proportion of rural health facilities in the state compared to the number of such facilities nationwide.The section additionally provides $200 million for FY2025 for the CMS to implement the program.&nbsp;Subtitle C--Increase in Debt Limit(Sec. 72001) This section increases the statutory debt limit by $5 trillion. (The debt limit is the amount of money that the Department of the Treasury may borrow to fund federal operations.)Subtitle D--Unemployment(Sec. 73001) This section prohibits payments under federal unemployment programs to individuals whose wages are $1 million or more. Such programs must include a method for individuals to certify that their income does not exceed this limit. State agencies that administer such programs must verify income information, to the extent possible, and provide for the recovery of any overpayments.&nbsp;TITLE VIII--COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONSThis title makes various changes to higher education, particularly to the federal student loan system.Subtitle A--Exemption of Certain Assets(Sec. 80001) This section exempts the assets of certain family farms, family-owned small businesses, and family-owned commercial fishing businesses from the information reported on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form.This exemption applies to the net worth of (1) a family farm on which the family resides, (2) a small business with not more than 100 full-time or full-time equivalent employees that is owned and controlled by the family, or (3) a commercial fishing business and related expenses (e.g., fishing vessels and permits) owned and controlled by the family.Prior to recent changes made to the FAFSA, the net worth of these family farms and family-owned small businesses were excluded as assets when calculating a student's financial need to determine federal student aid eligibility. Beginning with the 2024-2025 academic year, the net worth of these farms and businesses are treated as an asset and therefore included in the calculation. This section (1) restores the exemption to exclude the net worth of these family farms and family-owned small businesses from the calculation, and (2) expands the exemption to exclude the net worth of family-owned commercial fisheries from the calculation.Subtitle B--Loan LimitsThis subtitle makes various changes to federal student loans.&nbsp;(Sec. 81001)&nbsp;This section revises the types of federal student loans available to borrowers under the Direct Loan program and the borrowing limits for these loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The section terminates the ability of graduate or professional students to receive Direct PLUS Loans (i.e., Grad PLUS Loans) beginning on July 1, 2026.The section revises the annual and aggregate limits an individual may borrow in Direct Loans. In particular, the section establishes the aggregate loan limit for Direct Unsubsidized Loans as $100,000 for a graduate student (in addition to the amount borrowed for undergraduate education) and $200,000 for a professional student (in addition to the amount borrowed for undergraduate education).The section also places certain restrictions on Parent PLUS Loans beginning on July 1, 2026. In particular, the section sets an annual loan limit of $20,000 that may be borrowed on behalf of a dependent undergraduate student and a lifetime borrowing limit of $65,000 per dependent undergraduate student.The section also institutes new maximum aggregate limits for borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026. For example, the section sets an overall aggregate lifetime borrowing limit of $257,500 for any single borrower across federal loan types (except for Parent PLUS Loans).The section provides an exception to the loan limits described in this section (of up to three academic years) for a student who is already enrolled in a program of study and received a loan for the program.The section also&nbsp;requires that a student's loan amount for an academic year be prorated based on their enrollment intensity if the student is enrolled on a less-than-full-time basis.The section allows institutions of higher education (IHEs) to set lower loan limits&nbsp;if the limit is applied consistently to all students enrolled in the program.Subtitle C--Loan RepaymentThis subtitle revises loan repayment options for federal student loans.(Sec. 82001) This section terminates all current student loan repayment plans for new loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.The Department of Education (ED) may only offer borrowers two options for repayment of federal student loans: a standard repayment plan (with the length of the repayment term determined by the total amount borrowed) and an income-based repayment plan (to be known as the Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP). Consequently, borrowers with new loans made on or after July 1, 2026, are limited to these two repayment plans.Beginning on July 1, 2028, a borrower with a loan that is in a repayment status in accordance with, or an administrative forbearance associated with, an income-contingent repayment plan must begin repaying the loan under a new repayment plan. This applies to current borrowers who are on the following repayment plans: (1) the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, (2) the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plan, or (3) the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan. If a borrower does not select a plan, ED must enroll the borrower in either the RAP or the standard repayment plan.(Sec. 82002) This section eliminates economic hardship and unemployment deferments for borrowers who receive a federal student loan on or after July 1, 2027. A borrower who receives a loan on or after July 1, 2027, may only be eligible for a discretionary forbearance for no more than 9 months during a 24-month period.(Sec. 82003) This section allows borrowers to rehabilitate a defaulted loan twice (currently, only once). However, beginning on July 1, 2027, the borrower must pay a minimum payment amount of $10.(Sec. 82004) This section allows payments under the new RAP to count as qualifying payments for purposes of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.(Sec. 82005) This section provides funding to ED for administrative costs, including for the costs of student loan servicing.Subtitle D--Pell GrantsThis subtitle makes changes to Pell Grants.(Sec. 83001) This section requires foreign income that is exempt from taxation or foreign income for which an individual receives a foreign tax credit to be included in the adjusted gross income calculation for purposes of calculating eligibility for Pell Grants.Students with a student aid index (SAI) that equals or exceeds twice the amount of the total maximum Pell Grant are ineligible for Pell Grants, regardless of their adjusted gross income.&nbsp;(The SAI is a formula-based index number that represents a student's level of financial need. It is calculated using information that the student provides on the FAFSA form.)The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.(Sec. 83002) This section requires ED to award Workforce Pell Grants to students enrolled in eligible workforce programs. Eligible programs are those that provide at least 150 clock hours (but less than 600 clock hours) of instruction during a minimum of 8 weeks (but less than 15 weeks).The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.(Sec. 83003) This section provides additional funding of&nbsp;$10.5 billion for Pell Grants for FY2026.(Sec. 83004) This section makes a student ineligible for Pell Grants if the student receives grant aid from nonfederal sources (e.g., states, IHEs, or private sources) in an amount that equals or exceeds the student's cost of attendance.The section's changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.Subtitle E--Accountability(Sec. 84001) This section requires IHEs participating in federal student loan programs to comply with median earning requirements of students. Specifically, the section prohibits an IHE from using federal funds for student enrollment in low-earning outcome programs. Low-earning outcome programs are educational programs in which the graduating cohort of students earn less as working adults compared to those with lesser degrees (e.g., a high school diploma instead of a bachelor's degree).If an educational program does not meet the median earning requirements, the IHE must promptly notify each student enrolled in the program.ED must establish a process for an IHE with an educational program that has lost eligibility for federal funds to be able to apply to regain eligibility for such funds.IHEs must comply with these requirements beginning on July 1, 2026.Subtitle F--Regulatory Relief(Sec. 85001) This section delays until July 1, 2035, ED regulations pertaining to borrower defense to repayment. (Borrower defense to repayment is a legal ground for discharging Direct Loans if a school engaged in certain misconduct.) For loans that first originated before July 1, 2035, the section restores those regulations that were in effect on July 1, 2020. (Among other elements, the regulations in effect on July 1, 2020, require borrowers to meet a strict standard of misrepresentation to be eligible for a borrower defense discharge.)(Sec. 85002) This section delays until July 1, 2035, ED regulations pertaining to closed school discharges. (Under closed school discharge regulations, a borrower's liability to repay a federal student loan is discharged if the borrower&nbsp;does not complete the program of study for which the loan was made because the school the borrower attended has closed.) For loans that first originated before July 1, 2035, the section restores those regulations that were in effect prior to changes made in November 2022.

Prevent Government Shutdowns Act of 2025This bill provides continuing appropriations to prevent a government shutdown if the appropriations bills for a fiscal year have not been enacted before the fiscal year begins and continuing appropriations are not in effect.Specifically, the bill provides appropriations at the rate of operations that was provided for the prior fiscal year to continue programs, projects, and activities that were funded in the preceding fiscal year.The bill also limits official travel, congressional recesses or adjournments, and the consideration of legislation that is unrelated to appropriations after the beginning of a fiscal year if the appropriations process has not been completed. Congressional Money Returned to America Act or the Congressional&nbsp;MRA ActThis bill requires funds that were provided to House offices for the Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) and remain in the MRA account after all payments for the year are made to be deposited in the Treasury and used for deficit or debt reduction.&nbsp;The&nbsp;MRA is an allowance that Members of the House of Representatives receive each year to operate their offices. It must be used to support official and representational duties and may not be used for personal or campaign purposes.&nbsp;Annual appropriations acts that fund the legislative branch have generally included a provision that requires unused amounts remaining in the&nbsp;MRA to be used for deficit reduction or to reduce the federal debt. This bill makes this requirement permanent.&nbsp; Eliminate Lavish Incentives To Electric Vehicles Act or the ELITE Vehicles ActThis bill eliminates federal tax credits for the purchase of certain clean vehicles (generally electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles) and electric&nbsp;vehicle recharging stations.Specifically, the bill repeals the federal tax credits forthe purchase of a qualified used clean vehicle (tax credit of up to $4,000 for the purchase of a previously-owned clean vehicle before 2033),the purchase of a qualified new clean vehicle (tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a new clean vehicle before 2033),the purchase of a qualified commercial clean vehicle (business tax credit of up to $40,000 for the purchase of a commercial clean vehicle before 2033), andalternative fuel vehicle refueling property used to recharge electric vehicles (tax credit of up to $1,000 for individuals or up to $100,000 for businesses for the installation of property before 2033 that is used to recharge electric vehicles). One Big Beautiful Bill ActThis bill reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by 11 House committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE&nbsp;This title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).Subtitle A--Nutrition(Sec. 10001) This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation or update of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.As background, USDA created the&nbsp;TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.&nbsp;(Sec. 10002) This section expands the applicability of work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). As background, these SNAP recipients have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements.Specifically, the section amends the exemptions to this requirement.First, the section applies the work requirements for&nbsp;ABAWDs to adults who are not over 65 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.Second, the&nbsp;ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted to a dependent child under the age of seven. Currently, the child must be under the age of 18.&nbsp;This section includes an exception for a person who is (1) responsible for a dependent child who is seven years of age or older, and (2) married to and resides with an individual who complies with the SNAP work requirements.In addition, the section specifies that current&nbsp;ABAWD exemptions set to sunset on October 1, 2030 will sunset. These exemptions from the ABAWD work requirements are for homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals (those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age).(Sec. 10003) This section modifies the&nbsp;ABAWD waiver program's&nbsp;allowable state exemptions. Under current law, an&nbsp;ABAWD waiver program allows state exemptions based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs. The section amends the exemption to require the unemployment rate to be based on the rate for the county, instead of the area. Further, the section repeals the provision that allows a state exemption if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.Under current law, a state agency may exempt up to 8% of SNAP recipients from the&nbsp;ABAWD work requirements for each fiscal year. This section reduces the percentage of exemptions a state agency may provide each year so that the average monthly number of exemptions does not exceed 1% of covered individuals (i.e., SNAP recipients and certain individuals who were denied SNAP benefits due to the work requirements).&nbsp;(Sec. 10004) This section limits the availability of the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) for determining SNAP income eligibility. Specifically, only households that include an elderly or disabled member may be considered automatically eligible for the SUA based on participation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program.&nbsp;As background, when determining a household’s eligibility for SNAP, states consider the total shelter costs for a household, including the cost of utilities. States can use&nbsp;SUAs, which are standard amounts that represent low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Currently, all LIHEAP participants who receive a minimum benefit are eligible for the SUA for determining SNAP income eligibility.(Sec. 10005) This section prohibits household&nbsp;internet costs (e.g., monthly subscriber fees) from being used in computing the excess shelter expense deduction for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits.(Sec. 10006) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments. Currently, the state match is 0%. Beginning in FY2028, any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% must contribute a 5% match for the cost of SNAP program allotments.&nbsp;A state with a payment error rate that isat least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 15%;at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 20%; and10% or greater must contribute 25%.(Sec. 10007) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs, from the current 50%, thereby increasing the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.(Sec. 10008) This section modifies the general work requirements of the SNAP program to cover individuals who are over the age of 17 and under the age of 65. Currently, the general work requirements apply to individuals who are over the age of 15 and under the age of 60. It also exempts parents or members of a household with responsibility for the care of a child who is under the age of seven (under the age of six under current law) from the requirements.&nbsp;(Sec. 10009) This section requires state agencies (under the SNAP National Accuracy Clearinghouse) to use each indication of a multiple issuance of SNAP benefits to prevent multiple issuances of other federal and state assistance program benefits.(Sec. 10010) This section reduces the tolerance level to $0 for a state to exclude small SNAP payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates.&nbsp;As background, the SNAP quality control system measures how accurately SNAP state agencies determine a household’s eligibility and benefit amount and determines overpayments of benefits and underpayments. Under current law, the Food and Nutrition Service must set a tolerance level for excluding small payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates (e.g., $56 or less in FY2024). This section requires that the calculation of payment error rates include all SNAP payment errors.(Sec. 10011) This section eliminates the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED).(Sec. 10012) This section limits SNAP benefits to individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) a citizen, or (2) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as an immigrant, with exceptions. Currently, SNAP eligibility extends to additional individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law, including an alien who has qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws.This section also extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).Subtitle B--Investment in Rural America(Sec. 10101) This section amends and extends commodity support programs.For example, the section extends the Price Loss Coverage Program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, and Dairy Margin Coverage through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.The section also extends the suspension of permanent price authority through crop year 2031 for commodities other than dairy and through December 31, 2031, for dairy.Further, the section addresses programs and issues such as marketing loans, disaster assistance, the sugar program, federal crop insurance, the Livestock Indemnity Program, and the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program.For example, this section provides for a number of changes to Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), which includechanging the definition of production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;setting production history for the DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;raising the coverage limit to the first six million pounds for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first five million pounds; andallowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.(Sec. 10102) This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the following programs through FY2031:the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program,the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program,the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program,the Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP),the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP),the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP),the Rural Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), andthe Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program.This section also rescinds the&nbsp;unobligated funds that were provided for ACEP, EQIP, CSP, and RCPP conservation programs as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.&nbsp;(Sec. 10103) This section extends and provides increased funding for agricultural trade promotion and facilitation through FY2031. Specified funds are provided for the Market Access Program, Foreign Market Development Program, &nbsp;E (Kika) de la Garza Emerging Marketing Program, Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops program, and the Priority Trade Fund.(Sec. 10104) This section&nbsp;reauthorizes and provides funding for a number of USDA research initiatives.&nbsp;For example, this section provides specified funds to the 1890 National Scholars Program for FY2026 for student scholarships. This National Institute of Food and Agriculture program provides grants to 1890 Institutions (i.e., historically Black colleges and universities that belong to the U.S. land-grant university system) for students who intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.This section provides the Specialty Crop Research Initiative with $175 million in mandatory funding for FY2026. Currently, the program is funded at $80 million for each fiscal year.This section also provides funding for competitive grants to assist in the construction, alteration, acquisition, modernization, renovation, or remodeling of Agricultural Research Facilities.(Sec. 10105) This section extends and modifies the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program.&nbsp;Under the existing&nbsp;SRS program, states and counties containing federal land may receive payments from the U.S. Forest Service or the Department of the Interior respectively. This section extends the authority of the Forest Service and Interior to (1) calculate and provide payments to states and counties under the SRS program through FY2026, and (2) initiate projects using funds provided by the program through FY2028. It also extends the deadline to obligate those funds until the end of FY2029.This section rescinds specified&nbsp;unobligated funds that were provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for (1) competitive grants to nonfederal forest landowners, and (2) state and private forestry conservation programs.&nbsp;(Sec. 10106) This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the biobased markets program (i.e., BioPreferred Program) through FY2031 to promote biobased products through (1) mandatory purchasing requirements for federal agencies and their contractors, and (2) a voluntary labeling initiative for biobased products.This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels (i.e., Advanced Biofuel Payment Program) through FY2031. The program provides payments to fuel producers to support and expand production of advanced biofuels (i.e., not derived from corn starch).(Sec. 10107) This section provides additional funding for the Plant Pest and Disease Management Disaster Prevention Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter.This section provides additional funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter. Under the block grant program, USDA provides grants to the state departments of agriculture to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops (i.e., fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, including floriculture).The section also&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, organic production and market data initiatives through FY2031.&nbsp;This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for USDA to carry out the modernization and improvement of international trade technology systems and data collection on imports of organically produced agricultural products accepted into the United States.The section also&nbsp;reauthorizes the Organic Certification Cost Share Program, which provides cost share assistance to producers and handlers of agricultural products who are obtaining or renewing their certification under the National Organic Program.This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026 for the multiple crop and pesticide use survey of farmers. The USDA Office of Pest Management Policy conducts this survey to collect data for risk assessment modeling and mitigation for an active ingredient.(Sec. 10108) This section increases funding for the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. Specific increases in funding are also provided for the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and the National Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank.This section extends and increases funding for the Sheep Production &amp; Marketing Grant Program through FY2026. This program seeks to strengthen and enhance the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.This section also extends thePima Agriculture Cotton Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on cotton fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of cotton fabric;Agriculture Wool Apparel Manufacturers Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on wool fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of wool fabric;Wool Research and Promotion Program through FY2031, which provides grants to assist U.S. wool producers with improving the quality of wool and with developing and promoting the wool market; andEmergency Citrus Disease Research and Development Trust Fund through FY2031, which funds a program that aims to bring together scientists to find scientifically sound and financially sustainable solutions to Huanglongbing (i.e., citrus greening, a bacterial disease spread by an insect that feeds on citrus).TITLE II--COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES(Sec. 20001) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to the Department of Defense (DOD) forthe Marine Corps Barracks 2030 initiative,the Defense Health Program,supplemental payments of Basic Allowance for Housing to military personnel, andtuition assistance and child care assistance for members of the Armed Forces.The section also provides statutory authority to extend from 14 to 21 days eligibility for Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) for certain servicemembers undergoing a permanent change of station.Additionally, the section temporarily increases authorized investment amounts and provides additional authorization for the acquisition or construction of certain military housing through private contracts.(Sec. 20002) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the shipbuilding industrial base and various naval shipbuilding activities.&nbsp;(Sec. 20003) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the development of (1) space-based missile intercept capabilities, (2) military space-based sensors, and (3) the continued development of ground-based missile defense systems and related infrastructure.(Sec. 20004) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for various military weapon systems, including hypersonic, air-to-air, cruise, and anti-ship missiles.(Sec. 20005) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to expand the small, unmanned aerial system (UAS) industrial base, to advance the use of artificial intelligence in these and other systems, and to support the integration of commercial developments in military technology.The section also provides additional funding to finance loans and loan guarantees by the DOD Office of Strategic Capital.(Sec. 20006) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to replace current business systems, deploy automation, and deploy artificial intelligence to accelerate audits of DOD financial statements.(Sec. 20007) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to (1) modernize the capabilities of fighter, transport, and other military aircraft; (2) prevent the retirement of certain fighter aircraft (e.g., F-22); and (3) produce next-generation manned and unmanned aircraft.(Sec. 20008) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for nuclear defense resources and nuclear forces development and production.(Sec. 20009) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for (1) various military exercises and infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region, (2) classified military space-superiority programs, and (3) military support to the government of Taiwan.(Sec. 20010) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to enhance and modernize (1) military depots and shipyards, and (2) Special Operations Command (SOCOM) equipment.&nbsp;(Sec. 20011) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to support border operations, including deployment of military personnel.(Sec. 20012) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to enhance military intelligence programs.(Sec. 20013) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the DOD Office of Inspector General to monitor the activities for which funding is provided under this title.(Sec. 20014) This section authorizes each military department to use funding under this title for military construction, land acquisition, and military family housing.

Bureau of Land Management ordered the BLM to complete a new environmental impact statement (EIS) for the management plan under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires an agency to include all reasonable alternatives to its action and the environmental impacts resulting from the action. Specifically, the court ordered the BLM to issue an EIS that considers an alternative of not leasing coal under the management plan as well as an alternative that limits the amount of coal potentially available for leasing.In response to the court order, the&nbsp;BLM published an amendment to the plan on November 27, 2024.

(The debt limit is the amount of money that the Department of the Treasury may borrow to fund federal operations.)&nbsp; This resolution expresses concern about the presence and influence of China in Panamanian ports and infrastructure, particularly in facilities with strategic significance such as the ports of Balboa and Cristobal.The resolution calls on the Panamanian government to reaffirm its commitment to the permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal as defined by the Neutrality Treaty (i.e., the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, signed in 1977) and terminate agreements allowing Chinese state-owned enterprises or private entities based in China to manage such strategic infrastructure. The resolution also urges the U.S. government to (1) leverage provisions of the Neutrality Treaty to address threats to the neutrality of the Panama Canal, and (2)&nbsp;develop a U.S.-Panama task force to oversee canal security and operations. Protecting Military Installations and Ranges Act of 2025This bill places restrictions on the purchase of certain property by a foreign person (e.g., an individual or entity)&nbsp;who is owned or controlled by, is acting for or on behalf of, or receives subsidies from Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea.Specifically, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) must review a purchase or lease by, or a concession to, any such foreign person of private or public real estate in the United States that is within (1) 100 miles of a military installation; or (2) 50 miles of a military training route, special use airspace, a controlled firing area, or a military operations area.Further, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation may not issue final determinations regarding specified projects (e.g., energy projects) that involve a transaction under review by CFIUS until CFIUS concludes its action. This resolution directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to make several corrections in the engrossment of H.R. 1 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act).&nbsp;Specifically, the corrections strike provisions from the bill that&nbsp;make a conforming amendment to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act;reauthorize,&nbsp;and extend funding for, the Department of Agriculture's biobased markets program (i.e., BioPreferred Program) through FY2031;provide funding to the Department of Defense (DOD) for various intelligence-related activities and equipment, including enhancements to military intelligence programs;provide funding to DOD for exportable low-cost cruise missiles;provide funding for DOD to convert Ohio-class submarine tubes to accept additional missiles;specify that revisions to a land use plan may not prevent or delay the Department of the Interior from leasing certain federal land for oil and natural gas development;&nbsp;nullify the Bureau of Land Management’s Public Land Order No. 7917 for Withdrawal of Federal Lands; Cook, Lake, and Saint Louis Counties, MN that was published on January 31, 2023;reinstate certain&nbsp;hardrock mineral leases in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota;&nbsp;increase the penalty for aiding and abetting the understatement of tax liability with respect to the employee retention tax credit (ERTC) by a COVID-ERTC promoter and make other changes related to the&nbsp;ERTC; andspecify that provisions in the bill&nbsp;regarding certain Department of Health and Human Services regulations also apply to successor regulations. One Big Beautiful Bill ActThis bill reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by 11 House committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTUREThis title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).Subtitle A--Nutrition(Sec. 10001) This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation or update of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.As background, USDA created the TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.(Sec. 10002) This section expands the applicability of work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). As background, these SNAP recipients have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements.Specifically, the section amends the exemptions to this requirement.First, the section applies the work requirements for ABAWDs to adults who are not over 65 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.Second, the ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted to a dependent child under the age of seven. Currently, the child must be under the age of 18.This section includes an exception for a person who is (1) responsible for a dependent child who is seven years of age or older, and (2) married to and resides with an individual who complies with the SNAP work requirements.In addition, the section specifies that current ABAWD exemptions set to sunset on October 1, 2030 will sunset. These exemptions from the ABAWD work requirements are for homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals (those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age).(Sec. 10003) This section modifies the ABAWD waiver program's allowable state exemptions. Under current law, an ABAWD waiver program allows state exemptions based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs. The section amends the exemption to require the unemployment rate to be based on the rate for the county, instead of the area. Further, the section repeals the provision that allows a state exemption if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.Under current law, a state agency may exempt up to 8% of SNAP recipients from the ABAWD work requirements for each fiscal year. This section reduces the percentage of exemptions a state agency may provide each year so that the average monthly number of exemptions does not exceed 1% of covered individuals (i.e., SNAP recipients and certain individuals who were denied SNAP benefits due to the work requirements).(Sec. 10004) This section limits the availability of the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) for determining SNAP income eligibility. Specifically, only households that include an elderly or disabled member may be considered automatically eligible for the SUA based on participation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program.As background, when determining a household’s eligibility for SNAP, states consider the total shelter costs for a household, including the cost of utilities. States can use SUAs, which are standard amounts that represent low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Currently, all LIHEAP participants who receive a minimum benefit are eligible for the SUA for determining SNAP income eligibility.(Sec. 10005) This section prohibits household internet costs (e.g., monthly subscriber fees) from being used in computing the excess shelter expense deduction for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits.(Sec. 10006) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments. Currently, the state match is 0%. Beginning in FY2028, any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% must contribute a 5% match for the cost of SNAP program allotments.A state with a payment error rate that isat least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 15%;at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 20%; and10% or greater must contribute 25%.(Sec. 10007) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs, from the current 50%, thereby increasing the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.(Sec. 10008) This section modifies the general work requirements of the SNAP program to cover individuals who are over the age of 17 and under the age of 65. Currently, the general work requirements apply to individuals who are over the age of 15 and under the age of 60. It also exempts parents or members of a household with responsibility for the care of a child who is under the age of seven (under the age of six under current law) from the requirements.(Sec. 10009) This section requires state agencies (under the SNAP National Accuracy Clearinghouse) to use each indication of a multiple issuance of SNAP benefits to prevent multiple issuances of other federal and state assistance program benefits.(Sec. 10010) This section reduces the tolerance level to $0 for a state to exclude small SNAP payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates.As background, the SNAP quality control system measures how accurately SNAP state agencies determine a household’s eligibility and benefit amount and determines overpayments of benefits and underpayments. Under current law, the Food and Nutrition Service must set a tolerance level for excluding small payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates (e.g., $56 or less in FY2024). This section requires that the calculation of payment error rates include all SNAP payment errors.(Sec. 10011) This section eliminates the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED).(Sec. 10012) This section limits SNAP benefits to individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals; (2)&nbsp;aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence as an immigrant, with exceptions; (3) aliens who are Cuban citizens or Cuban nationals and meet certain requirements; or (4) individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and&nbsp;Palau.Currently, SNAP eligibility extends to additional individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law, including an alien who has qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws.(Sec. 10013)&nbsp;This section extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).Subtitle B--Investment in Rural America(Sec. 10101) This section amends and extends commodity support programs.For example, the section extends the Price Loss Coverage Program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, and Dairy Margin Coverage through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.The section also extends the suspension of permanent price authority through crop year 2031 for commodities other than dairy and through December 31, 2031, for dairy.Further, the section addresses programs and issues such as marketing loans, disaster assistance, the sugar program, federal crop insurance, the Livestock Indemnity Program, and the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program.For example, this section provides for a number of changes to Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), which includechanging the definition of production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;setting production history for the DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;raising the coverage limit to the first 6 million pounds for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first 5 million pounds; andallowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.(Sec. 10102) This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the following programs through FY2031:the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program,the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program,the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program,the Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP),the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP),the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP),the Rural Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), andthe Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program.This section also rescinds the&nbsp;unobligated funds that were provided for the ACEP, EQIP, CSP, and RCPP conservation programs as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.&nbsp;(Sec. 10103) This section directs USDA to conduct a program to encourage the accessibility, development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities.&nbsp;This section also provides $285 million in mandatory funding for the program for FY2027 and each fiscal year&nbsp;thereafter.(Sec. 10104) This section reauthorizes and provides funding for a number of USDA research initiatives.For example, this section provides specified funds to the 1890 National Scholars Program for FY2026 for student scholarships. This National Institute of Food and Agriculture program provides grants to 1890 Institutions (i.e., historically Black colleges and universities that belong to the U.S. land-grant university system) for students who intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.This section provides the Specialty Crop Research Initiative with $175 million in mandatory funding for FY2026. Currently, the program is funded at $80 million for each fiscal year.This section also provides funding for competitive grants to assist in the construction, alteration, acquisition, modernization, renovation, or remodeling of Agricultural Research Facilities.(Sec. 10105) This section extends and modifies the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program.Under the existing SRS program, states and counties containing federal land may receive payments from the U.S. Forest Service or the Department of the Interior respectively. This section extends the authority of the Forest Service and Interior to (1) calculate and provide payments to states and counties under the SRS program through FY2026, and (2) initiate projects using funds provided by the program through FY2028. It also extends the deadline to obligate those funds until the end of FY2029.This section rescinds specified unobligated funds that were provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for (1) competitive grants to nonfederal forest landowners, and (2) state and private forestry conservation programs.(Sec. 10106) This section reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels (i.e., Advanced Biofuel Payment Program) through FY2031. The program provides payments to fuel producers to support and expand production of advanced biofuels (i.e., not derived from corn starch).(Sec. 10107) This section provides additional funding for the Plant Pest and Disease Management Disaster Prevention Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter.This section provides additional funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter. Under the block grant program, USDA provides grants to the state departments of agriculture to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops (i.e., fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, including floriculture).The section also reauthorizes, and extends funding for, organic production and market data initiatives through FY2031.This section reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for USDA to carry out the modernization and improvement of international trade technology systems and data collection on imports of organically produced agricultural products accepted into the United States.The section also reauthorizes the Organic Certification Cost Share Program, which provides cost share assistance to producers and handlers of agricultural products who are obtaining or renewing their certification under the National Organic Program.This section reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for the multiple crop and pesticide use survey of farmers. The USDA Office of Pest Management Policy conducts this survey to collect data for risk assessment modeling and mitigation for an active ingredient.(Sec. 10108) This section increases funding for the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. Specific increases in funding are also provided for the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and the National Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank.This section extends and increases funding for the Sheep Production &amp; Marketing Grant Program through FY2026. This program seeks to strengthen and enhance the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.This section also extends thePima Agriculture Cotton Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on cotton fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of cotton fabric;Agriculture Wool Apparel Manufacturers Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on wool fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of wool fabric;Wool Research and Promotion Program through FY2031, which provides grants to assist U.S. wool producers with improving the quality of wool and with developing and promoting the wool market; andEmergency Citrus Disease Research and Development Trust Fund through FY2031, which funds a program that aims to bring together scientists to find scientifically sound and financially sustainable solutions to Huanglongbing (i.e., citrus greening, a bacterial disease spread by an insect that feeds on citrus).TITLE II--COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES(Sec. 20001) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to the Department of Defense (DOD) forthe Marine Corps Barracks 2030 initiative,the Defense Health Program,supplemental payments of Basic Allowance for Housing to military personnel, andtuition assistance and child care assistance for members of the Armed Forces.The section also provides statutory authority to extend from 14 to 21 days eligibility for Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) for certain servicemembers undergoing a permanent change of station.Additionally, the section temporarily increases authorized investment amounts and provides additional authorization for the acquisition or construction of certain military housing through private contracts.(Sec. 20002) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the shipbuilding industrial base and various naval shipbuilding activities.&nbsp;(Sec. 20003) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the development of (1) space-based missile intercept capabilities, (2) military space-based sensors, and (3) the continued development of ground-based missile defense systems and related infrastructure.(Sec. 20004) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for various military weapon systems, including hypersonic, air-to-air, cruise, and anti-ship missiles.(Sec. 20005) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to expand the small, unmanned aerial system (UAS) industrial base, to advance the use of artificial intelligence in these and other systems, and to support the integration of commercial developments in military technology.The section also provides additional funding to finance loans and loan guarantees by the DOD Office of Strategic Capital.(Sec. 20006) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to replace current business systems, deploy automation, and deploy artificial intelligence to accelerate audits of DOD financial statements.(Sec. 20007) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to (1) modernize the capabilities of fighter, transport, and other military aircraft; (2) prevent the retirement of certain fighter aircraft (e.g., F-22); and (3) produce next-generation manned and unmanned aircraft.(Sec. 20008) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for nuclear defense resources and nuclear forces development and production.(Sec. 20009) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for (1) various military exercises and infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region, and (2) classified military space-superiority programs.(Sec. 20010) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to enhance and modernize (1) military depots and shipyards, and (2) Special Operations Command (SOCOM) equipment.&nbsp;(Sec. 20011) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to support border operations, including deployment of military personnel.(Sec. 20012) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the DOD Office of Inspector General to monitor the activities for which funding is provided under this title.(Sec. 20013) This section authorizes each military department to use funding under this title for military construction, land acquisition, and military family housing.

The section specifies eligibility for certain nationals of Cuba and individuals who lawfully reside in the United States in accordance with a Compact of Free Association (i.e.,&nbsp;individuals from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau).(Sec. 30002) This section changes the way student eligibility for need-based federal aid is calculated by basing the calculation on the median cost of attendance by program of study from all institutions of higher education (IHEs) that offer such program of study rather than the cost of attendance of a student’s specific program as determined by their IHE.The section also restores an exemption for certain family farms and small businesses on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. This exemption applies to the net worth of (1) a family farm on which the family resides, or (2) a small business with not more than 100 full-time or full-time equivalent employees that is owned and controlled by the family.Subtitle B--Loan LimitsThis subtitle makes various changes to federal student loans.&nbsp;(Sec. 30011) This section terminates the ability of undergraduate students to receive subsidized loans and terminates the ability of graduate or professional students to receive Direct PLUS Loans beginning on July 1, 2026. It provides an exception (of up to three academic years) for a student who is already enrolled in a program of study and received a loan for the program.&nbsp;The section also places certain restrictions on Parent PLUS Loans. In particular, parents may only borrow a Parent Plus Loan if the dependent student has already taken out their maximum annual unsubsidized loan amount.&nbsp;The section also establishes new annual and aggregate loan limits for borrowers. For example, the section sets an overall aggregate lifetime borrowing limit of $200,000 for any single borrower across federal loan types (except for Federal Direct PLUS Loans and Parent PLUS Loans).The section allows IHEs to set lower loan limits.Subtitle C--Loan RepaymentThis subtitle revises loan repayment options for federal student loans.(Sec. 30021) This section terminates all current student loan repayment plans for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.The Department of Education (ED) may only offer borrowers two options for repayment of federal student loans: a standard repayment plan (with the length of the repayment term determined by the total amount borrowed) and an income-based repayment plan (to be known as the Repayment Assistance Plan).(Sec. 30022) This section eliminates economic hardship and unemployment deferments beginning on July 1, 2025. It also reduces the total period a borrower may be in forbearance.A borrower who is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency program may be eligible for a forbearance in which no interest accrues for the first four 12-month intervals. However, interest does accrue for any subsequent 12-month interval.&nbsp;(Sec. 30023) This section allows borrowers to rehabilitate a defaulted loan twice (currently, only once). However, beginning on July 1, 2025, the borrower must pay a minimum payment amount of $10.(Sec. 30024) This section allows payments under the new Repayment Assistance Plan to count as qualifying payments for purposes of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.The section also specifies that a public service job, for purposes of the PSLF program, does not include time served in a medical or dental internship or residency program by an individual who, as of June 30, 2025, has not borrowed a Federal Direct PLUS Loan or a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan.&nbsp;(Sec. 30025) This section provides FY2025 and FY2026 funding to ED for administrative costs.Subtitle D--Pell GrantsThis subtitle makes changes to Pell Grants.(Sec. 30031) This section requires foreign income that is exempt from taxation or foreign income for which an individual receives a foreign tax credit to be included in the adjusted gross income calculation for purposes of calculating eligibility for Pell Grants.Students with a student aid index that equals or exceeds twice the amount of the total maximum Pell Grant are ineligible for Pell Grants, regardless of their adjusted gross income.&nbsp;The section also increases the number of credits needed to qualify for full-time enrollment in order to receive Pell Grants.The section prohibits a student who is enrolled less than half time from receiving a Pell Grant.The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.(Sec. 30032) This section requires ED to award Workforce Pell Grants to students enrolled in eligible workforce programs. Eligible programs are those that provide at least 150 clock hours (but less than 600 clock hours) of instruction during a minimum of 8 weeks (but less than 15 weeks).The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.(Sec. 30033) This section increases funding for Pell Grants for FY2026-FY2028.Subtitle E--AccountabilityThis subtitle creates a new risk-sharing framework for IHEs.(Sec. 30041) This section requires IHEs participating in federal student loan programs to make annual risk-sharing payments based on the nonrepayment balance of student loan cohorts.&nbsp;The section also outlines penalties for late or missing payments. For example, the section prohibits an IHE from offering Direct Loans to students if the IHE has not made a payment within 12 months of receiving a notification from ED. The section also prohibits an IHE from offering Direct Loans or awarding Pell Grants if the IHE has not made a risk-sharing payment in 18 months. If an IHE fails to make a payment within two years, the IHE may not participate in federal student loan programs for a minimum of 10 years.The section’s changes take effect beginning with award year 2028-2029.(Sec. 30042) This section establishes the Promoting Real Opportunities to Maximize Investments and Savings in Education (PROMISE) grant program. To receive a PROMISE grant, an IHE must meet maximum total price guarantee requirements (as outlined in the section).

Under this section, to be eligible for the tax credit, the construction on the geothermal facility must begin before 2032. (Under current law, the energy investment tax credit is available for investments in geothermal facility for which construction begins before 2035.)This section also disallows the energy investment tax credit for certain foreign entities, facilities that receive material assistance from certain foreign entities, and taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities.(Sec. 112018) This section increases the limitation on the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes (commonly known as the SALT deduction cap) to $40,400 (or $20,200 for married individuals filing separately). Under this section, the SALT deduction cap is reduced for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income over $505,000 (or $202,500 for married individuals filing separately), but not below $10,000 (or $5,000 for married individuals filing separately).The section increases the dollar amounts for the limitations on the SALT deduction by 1% per year for tax years 2027-2033 and establishes a permanent limitation for subsequent years that is equal to the 2033 levels.This section also&nbsp;prohibits the SALT deduction for foreign real property taxes (other than foreign real property taxes paid or accrued by certain entities in carrying out a trade or business),prohibits certain partnerships and S corporations from claiming the SALT deduction for specific taxes, andlimits the SALT deduction for payments made to a state or local jurisdiction that generate a specific tax benefit.(Sec. 112021) This section&nbsp; replaces the excise tax of 1.4% imposed on the net investment income of certain private university and college endowments with a new rate structure of 1.4%, 7%, 14%, or 21%, depending on several variables including the value of the endowment and the number of full-time students who meet certain other requirements.(Sec. 112029) This section removes firearm silencers from the definition of a firearm under the National Firearms Act of 1934 and eliminates the $200 excise tax on the making or transfer of firearm silencers.For more information seeCRS Report R46865, Energy Tax Provisions: Overview and Budgetary CostCRS Report R46246, The SALT Cap: Overview and AnalysisCRS Report R44293, College and University Endowments: Overview and Tax Policy OptionsPart 2--Removing Taxpayer Benefits for Illegal ImmigrantsThis part modifies eligibility requirements for the premium tax credit and certain other tax credits. This part also imposes an excise tax on certain remittance transfers.Below are some examples of provisions in this part.&nbsp;(Sec. 112101) This section&nbsp; allows lawfully-present aliens to claim the premium tax credit to purchase health insurance on an exchange only if they meet certain requirements (subject to exceptions provided in Sec. 112102).(Sec. 112102) &nbsp;This section repeals the rule that allows certain lawfully-present aliens who have a household income of less than 100% of the federal poverty level and are ineligible for Medicaid (based on the individual’s alien status) to claim the premium tax credit.&nbsp;(Sec. 112103) This section limits Medicare benefits to an individual who isa U.S. citizen or national;an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence;an alien who is a Cuban citizen or national and meets certain requirements; oran individual who is lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.This section also requires the Social Security Administration to identify individuals who do not meet the Medicare eligibility requirements of this section and to notify such individuals of the termination (one year from the date this section is enacted) of their Medicare benefits.&nbsp;(Sec. 112104) This section establishes a 3.5% excise tax on transfers of payments from one country to another (also known as remittance transfers).

(Sec. 112205) This section establishes a new certification program for claiming the earned income tax credit.(Sec. 112206) This section directs the Internal Revenue Service to terminate the Direct File program.(Sec. 112207) This section increases the penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer information.For more information see&nbsp;CRS Report R43805, The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): How It Works and Who Receives ItSubtitle D--Increase in Debt Limit(Sec. 113001) This section increases the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion. (The debt limit is the amount of money that the Department of the Treasury may borrow to fund federal operations.) One Big Beautiful Bill ActThis bill reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by 11 House committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE&nbsp;This title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).Subtitle A--Nutrition(Sec. 10001) This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation or update of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.As background, USDA created the&nbsp;TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.&nbsp;(Sec. 10002) This section expands the applicability of work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). As background, these SNAP recipients have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements.Specifically, the section amends the exemptions to this requirement.First, the section applies the work requirements for&nbsp;ABAWDs to adults who are not over 65 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.Second, the&nbsp;ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted to a dependent child under the age of seven. Currently, the child must be under the age of 18.&nbsp;This section includes an exception for a person who is (1) responsible for a dependent child who is seven years of age or older, and (2) married to and resides with an individual who complies with the SNAP work requirements.In addition, the section specifies that current&nbsp;ABAWD exemptions set to sunset on October 1, 2030 will sunset. These exemptions from the ABAWD work requirements are for homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals (those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age).(Sec. 10003) This section modifies the&nbsp;ABAWD waiver program's&nbsp;allowable state exemptions. Under current law, an&nbsp;ABAWD waiver program allows state exemptions based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs. The section amends the exemption to require the unemployment rate to be based on the rate for the county, instead of the area. Further, the section repeals the provision that allows a state exemption if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.Under current law, a state agency may exempt up to 8% of SNAP recipients from the&nbsp;ABAWD work requirements for each fiscal year. This section reduces the percentage of exemptions a state agency may provide each year so that the average monthly number of exemptions does not exceed 1% of covered individuals (i.e., SNAP recipients and certain individuals who were denied SNAP benefits due to the work requirements).&nbsp;(Sec. 10004) This section limits the availability of the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) for determining SNAP income eligibility. Specifically, only households that include an elderly or disabled member may be considered automatically eligible for the SUA based on participation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program.&nbsp;As background, when determining a household’s eligibility for SNAP, states consider the total shelter costs for a household, including the cost of utilities. States can use&nbsp;SUAs, which are standard amounts that represent low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Currently, all LIHEAP participants who receive a minimum benefit are eligible for the SUA for determining SNAP income eligibility.(Sec. 10005) This section prohibits household&nbsp;internet costs (e.g., monthly subscriber fees) from being used in computing the excess shelter expense deduction for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits.(Sec. 10006) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments. Currently, the state match is 0%. Beginning in FY2028, any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% must contribute a 5% match for the cost of SNAP program allotments.&nbsp;A state with a payment error rate that isat least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 15%;at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 20%; and10% or greater must contribute 25%.(Sec. 10007) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs, from the current 50%, thereby increasing the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.(Sec. 10008) This section modifies the general work requirements of the SNAP program to cover individuals who are over the age of 17 and under the age of 65. Currently, the general work requirements apply to individuals who are over the age of 15 and under the age of 60. It also exempts parents or members of a household with responsibility for the care of a child who is under the age of seven (under the age of six under current law) from the requirements.&nbsp;(Sec. 10009) This section requires state agencies (under the SNAP National Accuracy Clearinghouse) to use each indication of a multiple issuance of SNAP benefits to prevent multiple issuances of other federal and state assistance program benefits.(Sec. 10010) This section reduces the tolerance level to $0 for a state to exclude small SNAP payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates.&nbsp;As background, the SNAP quality control system measures how accurately SNAP state agencies determine a household’s eligibility and benefit amount and determines overpayments of benefits and underpayments. Under current law, the Food and Nutrition Service must set a tolerance level for excluding small payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates (e.g., $56 or less in FY2024). This section requires that the calculation of payment error rates include all SNAP payment errors.(Sec. 10011) This section eliminates the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED).(Sec. 10012) This section limits SNAP benefits to individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) a citizen, or (2) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as an immigrant, with exceptions. Currently, SNAP eligibility extends to additional individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law, including an alien who has qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws.This section also extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).Subtitle B--Investment in Rural America(Sec. 10101) This section amends and extends commodity support programs.For example, the section extends the Price Loss Coverage Program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, and Dairy Margin Coverage through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.The section also extends the suspension of permanent price authority through crop year 2031 for commodities other than dairy and through December 31, 2031, for dairy.Further, the section addresses programs and issues such as marketing loans, disaster assistance, the sugar program, federal crop insurance, the Livestock Indemnity Program, and the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program.For example, this section provides for a number of changes to Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), which includechanging the definition of production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;setting production history for the DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;raising the coverage limit to the first six million pounds for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first five million pounds; andallowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.(Sec. 10102) This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the following programs through FY2031:the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program,the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program,the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program,the Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP),the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP),the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP),the Rural Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), andthe Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program.This section also rescinds the&nbsp;unobligated funds that were provided for ACEP, EQIP, CSP, and RCPP conservation programs as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.&nbsp;(Sec. 10103) This section extends and provides increased funding for agricultural trade promotion and facilitation through FY2031. Specified funds are provided for the Market Access Program, Foreign Market Development Program, &nbsp;E (Kika) de la Garza Emerging Marketing Program, Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops program, and the Priority Trade Fund.(Sec. 10104) This section&nbsp;reauthorizes and provides funding for a number of USDA research initiatives.&nbsp;For example, this section provides specified funds to the 1890 National Scholars Program for FY2026 for student scholarships. This National Institute of Food and Agriculture program provides grants to 1890 Institutions (i.e., historically Black colleges and universities that belong to the U.S. land-grant university system) for students who intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.This section provides the Specialty Crop Research Initiative with $175 million in mandatory funding for FY2026. Currently, the program is funded at $80 million for each fiscal year.This section also provides funding for competitive grants to assist in the construction, alteration, acquisition, modernization, renovation, or remodeling of Agricultural Research Facilities.(Sec. 10105) This section extends and modifies the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program.&nbsp;Under the existing&nbsp;SRS program, states and counties containing federal land may receive payments from the U.S. Forest Service or the Department of the Interior respectively. This section extends the authority of the Forest Service and Interior to (1) calculate and provide payments to states and counties under the SRS program through FY2026, and (2) initiate projects using funds provided by the program through FY2028. It also extends the deadline to obligate those funds until the end of FY2029.This section rescinds specified&nbsp;unobligated funds that were provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for (1) competitive grants to nonfederal forest landowners, and (2) state and private forestry conservation programs.&nbsp;(Sec. 10106) This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the biobased markets program (i.e., BioPreferred Program) through FY2031 to promote biobased products through (1) mandatory purchasing requirements for federal agencies and their contractors, and (2) a voluntary labeling initiative for biobased products.This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels (i.e., Advanced Biofuel Payment Program) through FY2031. The program provides payments to fuel producers to support and expand production of advanced biofuels (i.e., not derived from corn starch).(Sec. 10107) This section provides additional funding for the Plant Pest and Disease Management Disaster Prevention Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter.This section provides additional funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter. Under the block grant program, USDA provides grants to the state departments of agriculture to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops (i.e., fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, including floriculture).The section also&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, organic production and market data initiatives through FY2031.&nbsp;This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for USDA to carry out the modernization and improvement of international trade technology systems and data collection on imports of organically produced agricultural products accepted into the United States.The section also&nbsp;reauthorizes the Organic Certification Cost Share Program, which provides cost share assistance to producers and handlers of agricultural products who are obtaining or renewing their certification under the National Organic Program.This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026 for the multiple crop and pesticide use survey of farmers. The USDA Office of Pest Management Policy conducts this survey to collect data for risk assessment modeling and mitigation for an active ingredient.(Sec. 10108) This section increases funding for the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. Specific increases in funding are also provided for the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and the National Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank.This section extends and increases funding for the Sheep Production &amp; Marketing Grant Program through FY2026. This program seeks to strengthen and enhance the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.This section also extends thePima Agriculture Cotton Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on cotton fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of cotton fabric;Agriculture Wool Apparel Manufacturers Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on wool fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of wool fabric;Wool Research and Promotion Program through FY2031, which provides grants to assist U.S. wool producers with improving the quality of wool and with developing and promoting the wool market; andEmergency Citrus Disease Research and Development Trust Fund through FY2031, which funds a program that aims to bring together scientists to find scientifically sound and financially sustainable solutions to Huanglongbing (i.e., citrus greening, a bacterial disease spread by an insect that feeds on citrus).TITLE II--COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES(Sec. 20001) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to the Department of Defense (DOD) forthe Marine Corps Barracks 2030 initiative,the Defense Health Program,supplemental payments of Basic Allowance for Housing to military personnel, andtuition assistance and child care assistance for members of the Armed Forces.The section also provides statutory authority to extend from 14 to 21 days eligibility for Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) for certain servicemembers undergoing a permanent change of station.Additionally, the section temporarily increases authorized investment amounts and provides additional authorization for the acquisition or construction of certain military housing through private contracts.(Sec. 20002) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the shipbuilding industrial base and various naval shipbuilding activities.&nbsp;(Sec. 20003) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the development of (1) space-based missile intercept capabilities, (2) military space-based sensors, and (3) the continued development of ground-based missile defense systems and related infrastructure.(Sec. 20004) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for various military weapon systems, including hypersonic, air-to-air, cruise, and anti-ship missiles.(Sec. 20005) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to expand the small, unmanned aerial system (UAS) industrial base, to advance the use of artificial intelligence in these and other systems, and to support the integration of commercial developments in military technology.The section also provides additional funding to finance loans and loan guarantees by the DOD Office of Strategic Capital.(Sec. 20006) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to replace current business systems, deploy automation, and deploy artificial intelligence to accelerate audits of DOD financial statements.(Sec. 20007) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to (1) modernize the capabilities of fighter, transport, and other military aircraft; (2) prevent the retirement of certain fighter aircraft (e.g., F-22); and (3) produce next-generation manned and unmanned aircraft.(Sec. 20008) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for nuclear defense resources and nuclear forces development and production.(Sec. 20009) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for (1) various military exercises and infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region, (2) classified military space-superiority programs, and (3) military support to the government of Taiwan.(Sec. 20010) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to enhance and modernize (1) military depots and shipyards, and (2) Special Operations Command (SOCOM) equipment.&nbsp;(Sec. 20011) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to support border operations, including deployment of military personnel.(Sec. 20012) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to enhance military intelligence programs.(Sec. 20013) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the DOD Office of Inspector General to monitor the activities for which funding is provided under this title.(Sec. 20014) This section authorizes each military department to use funding under this title for military construction, land acquisition, and military family housing.

The section specifies eligibility for certain nationals of Cuba, Ukraine, or Afghanistan, and individuals who lawfully reside in the United States in accordance with a Compact of Free Association (i.e., the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of&nbsp;Palau).(Sec. 30002) This section changes the way student eligibility for need-based federal aid is calculated by basing the calculation on the median cost of attendance by program of study from all institutions of higher education (IHEs) that offer such program of study rather than the cost of attendance of a student’s specific program as determined by their IHE.The section also restores an exemption for certain family farms and small businesses on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. This section applies to the net worth of (1) a family farm on which the family resides, or (2) a small business with not more than 100 full-time or full-time equivalent employees that is owned and controlled by the family.Subtitle B--Loan LimitsThis subtitle makes various changes to federal student loans.&nbsp;(Sec. 30011) This section terminates the ability of undergraduate students to receive subsidized loans and terminates the ability of graduate or professional students to receive Direct PLUS Loans beginning on July 1, 2026. It provides an exception (of up to three academic years) for a student who is already enrolled in a program of study and received a loan for the program.&nbsp;The section also places certain restrictions on Parent PLUS Loans. In particular, parents may only borrow a Parent Plus Loan if the dependent student has already taken out their maximum annual unsubsidized loan amount.&nbsp;The section also establishes new annual and aggregate loan limits for borrowers. For example, the section sets an overall aggregate lifetime borrowing limit of $200,000 for any single borrower across all federal loan types.The section allows&nbsp;IHEs to set lower loan limits.Subtitle C--Loan RepaymentThis subtitle revises loan repayment options for federal student loans.(Sec. 30021) This section terminates all current student loan repayment plans for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.The Department of Education (ED) may only offer borrowers two options for repayment of federal student loans: a standard repayment plan (with the length of the repayment term determined by the total amount borrowed) and an income-based repayment plan (to be known as the Repayment Assistance Plan).(Sec. 30022) This section eliminates economic hardship and unemployment deferments beginning on July 1, 2025. It also reduces the total period a borrower may be in forbearance.A borrower who is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency program may be eligible for a forbearance in which no interest accrues for the first four 12-month intervals. However, interest begins to accrue for any subsequent 12-month interval.&nbsp;(Sec. 30023) This section allows borrowers to rehabilitate a defaulted loan twice (currently, only once). However, beginning on July 1, 2025, the borrower must pay a minimum payment amount of $10.(Sec. 30024) This section allows payments under the new Repayment Assistance Plan to count as qualifying payments for purposes of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.The section also specifies that a public service job, for purposes of the&nbsp;PSLF program, does not include time served in a medical or dental internship or residency program by an individual who, as of June 30, 2025, has not borrowed a Federal Direct PLUS Loan or a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan.&nbsp;(Sec. 30025) This section provides FY2025 and FY2026 funding to ED for administrative costs.Subtitle D--Pell GrantsThis subtitle makes changes to&nbsp;Pell Grants.(Sec. 30031) This section requires foreign income that is exempt from taxation or foreign income for which an individual receives a foreign tax credit to be included in the adjusted gross income calculation for purposes of calculating eligibility for&nbsp;Pell Grants.Students with a student aid index that equals or exceeds twice the amount of the total maximum&nbsp;Pell Grant are ineligible for Pell Grants, regardless of their adjusted gross income.&nbsp;The section also increases the number of credits needed to qualify for full-time enrollment in order to receive&nbsp;Pell Grants.The section prohibits a student who is enrolled less than half time from receiving a&nbsp;Pell Grant.The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2025.(Sec. 30032) This section requires ED to award Workforce&nbsp;Pell Grants to students enrolled in eligible workforce programs. Eligible programs are those that provide at least 150 clock hours (but less than 600 clock hours) of instruction during a minimum of 8 weeks (but less than 15 weeks).The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.(Sec. 30033) This section increases funding for&nbsp;Pell Grants for FY2026-FY2028.Subtitle E--AccountabilityThis subtitle creates a new risk-sharing framework for&nbsp;IHEs.(Sec. 30041) This section requires&nbsp;IHEs participating in federal student loan programs to make annual risk-sharing payments based on the nonrepayment balance of student loan cohorts.&nbsp;The section also outlines penalties for late or missing payments. For example, the section prohibits an&nbsp;IHE from offering Direct Loans to students if the IHE has not made a payment within 12 months of receiving a notification from ED. The section also prohibits an IHE from offering Direct Loans or awarding Pell Grants if the IHE has not made a risk-sharing payment in 18 months. If an IHE fails to make a payment within two years, the IHE may not participate in federal student loan programs for a minimum of 10 years.The section’s changes take effect beginning with award year 2028-2029.(Sec. 30042) This section establishes the Promoting Real Opportunities to Maximize Investments and Savings in Education (PROMISE) grant program.

Coverage is limited to those under a certain age (age 68 in 2028, increased by one year every year thereafter) and to one test every 11 months. This bill nullifies two presidential memoranda that were published on January 6, 2025, including (1) the Memorandum on the Withdrawal of Certain Areas of the United States Outer Continental Shelf from Oil or Natural Gas Leasing, relating to the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, and Pacific areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS); and (2) the Memorandum on the Withdrawal of Certain Areas of the United States Outer Continental Shelf from Oil or Natural Gas Leasing, relating to&nbsp;the Bering Sea areas of the OCS. The memoranda&nbsp;prohibited the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) from issuing offshore leases for the exploration, development, or production (i.e., offshore drilling) of oil or natural gas in those areas.This bill reverses the withdrawal to allow&nbsp;BOEM to issue leases in&nbsp;those areas. WHO is Accountable ActThis bill prohibits the use of federal funds to seek U.S. membership in the World Health Organization (WHO), or to make contributions to the WHO, until the Department of State makes certain certifications to Congress.Specifically, these prohibitions shall apply until the State Department certifies that the WHO has met certain conditions, including that the WHO (1) has adopted reforms to ensure that humanitarian assistance is not politicized; (2) is not under the control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and is not involved in a cover-up of the CCP's response to the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) has granted observer status to Taiwan; and (4) has ceased engagement on certain issues, such as climate change, access to abortion, and gender identity. This concurrent resolution establishes the congressional budget for the federal government for FY2025, sets forth budgetary levels for FY2026-FY2034, and provides reconciliation instructions for legislation that increases or decreases the deficit and increases the statutory debt limit by specified amounts.&nbsp;The resolution recommends levels and amounts for FY2025-FY2034 forfederal revenues,new budget authority,budget outlays,deficits,debt subject to limit,&nbsp;debt held by the public, andthe major functional categories of spending.The resolution includes reconciliation instructions that direct 11 House committees to submit legislation that will increase or decrease the deficit over FY2025-FY2034 and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. The committees must submit the legislation to the House Budget Committee by March 27, 2025.&nbsp;(Under current law, reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)In addition, the resolution establishes a reserve fund that allows certain adjustments to committee allocations and other budgetary levels to accommodate reconciliation legislation.The resolution also requires the maximum deficit increase permitted by the reconciliation instruction for the House Ways and Means Committee ($4.5 trillion in the resolution) to be reduced if the proposals submitted by certain committees do not achieve a total of at least $2 trillion in net deficit reduction (or increased if more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction is achieved).&nbsp;Finally, the resolution sets forth budget enforcement procedures that address issues such as adjustments to committee allocations and the budgetary treatment of the discretionary administrative expenses for the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service.&nbsp; This joint resolution nullifies the final rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security titled Modernizing H-1B Requirements, Providing Flexibility in the F-1 Program, and Program Improvements Affecting Other Nonimmigrant Workers and published on December 18, 2024.

This joint resolution nullifies the final rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security titled Increase of the Automatic Extension Period of Employment Authorization and Documentation for Certain Employment Authorization Document Renewal Applicants and published on December 13, 2024. This rule makes permanent the increase&nbsp;of the automatic extension period from 180 days to 540 days for expiring employment authorization documents. The extension applies to eligible noncitizens who renew these authorizations on time. This joint resolution nullifies the final rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security titled Modernizing H–2 Program Requirements, Oversight, and Worker Protections and published on December 18, 2024. This rule modifies several regulations applicable to agricultural (H-2A) and nonagricultural (H-2B) temporary nonimmigrant workers, including by providing additional whistleblower protections for these workers, eliminating the differential treatment of nationals of countries designated as eligible, and establishing a 60-day grace period for workers after the revocation or cessation of eligible employment."

The bill expands eligibility for Department of Defense retired pay to such members who are physically disabled as a result of state active duty after September 23, 1996. Such pay must be reduced if it is determined to duplicate any other federal or state benefit to such members based on disability. The bill also makes such members eligible for hospital care and medical services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to treat the disability and any illness or condition arising from the disability. The VA may provide reimbursement for hospital care or medical services provided to such members only after a member or the provider of care has exhausted (without success) all claims and remedies reasonably available against a third party.

         "Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program Improvement Act of 2025This bill revises the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), which is a component of the Farm Service Agency's (FSA's) Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). CREP is a public-private partnership program which allows states, tribal governments, and nonprofit and private entities to partner with FSA to implement CRP practices. CRP is a land conservation program that provides an annual rental payment to farmers in exchange for removing environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and planting species that will improve environmental health and quality.The bill specifies that dryland agricultural uses and grazing are included as appropriate practices under CREP.The bill also allows a land owner or operator to elect to determine the annual payment amount allocated for each year of a CREP agreement, instead of a fixed payment per year for the contract period.For drought and water conservation agreements that include the permanent retirement of water rights, annual payment rates must be equal to the irrigated acre payment rates determined by the Department of Agriculture (USDA). In the case of an agreement that permits dryland agricultural uses, the annual payment rates must be equal to the difference between the irrigated acre payment rates and the dryland acre payment rates determined by USDA. The payment formula is retroactive for certain&nbsp;existing drought and water conservation agreements.Further, the bill exempts CREP payments from the $50,000 annual payment limitation under CRP.

Trust the Science Act This bill directs the Department of the Interior to remove protections for the gray wolf under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). Specifically, the bill requires Interior to reissue the final rule titled Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Removing the Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and published on November 3, 2020. The rule removed the gray wolf in the lower 48 United States, except for the Mexican wolf (C. l. baileyi) subspecies, from the endangered and threatened species list. However, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California vacated the rule on February 10, 2022. As a result, the gray wolf reattained the protection status it had prior to the rule's promulgation.  The bill also prohibits the reissuance of the rule from being subject to judicial review. Western Water Accelerated Revenue Repayment ActThis bill permanently authorizes a provision under the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act that (1) allows certain water users (e.g., agriculture and municipal water users) in western states to prepay what they owe under contracts with the Bureau of Reclamation for delivering water through a lump sum payment or over a period of three years; and (2) requires a specified portion of the receipts generated from such prepayments be directed to the Reclamation Water Storage Account for the construction of water storage. Such prepayments do not alter certain requirements for the disposition of amounts that are directed by project-specific&nbsp;statutes in effect prior to the passage of the&nbsp;WIIN Act to accounts other than the General Reclamation Fund. Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit ActThis bill reduces payments that communities within the Arkansas River Valley must pay to the Bureau of Reclamation for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline in Colorado for delivering water from the Pueblo Reservoir to such communities. Specifically, it removes interest payments and extends the repayment period to 100 years. Protecting American Energy Production ActThis bill prohibits the President from declaring a moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracturing unless Congress authorizes the moratorium. The bill also expresses the sense of Congress that states should maintain primacy&nbsp;(authority) for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas production on state and private lands.Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process to extract underground resources such as oil or gas from a geologic formation by injecting water, a propping agent (e.g., sand), and chemical additives into a well under enough pressure to fracture the formation.

Farmland Security Act of 2025This bill&nbsp;authorizes increased civil penalties for violations of the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 (AFIDA)&nbsp;and increases Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversight of and research into foreign investment in agricultural land.&nbsp;As background, AFIDA and the regulations that implemented the act require foreign investors who acquire, transfer, or hold an interest in U.S. agricultural land to report such holdings and transactions to USDA.In general, the bill allows USDA to determine an appropriate civil penalty amount for an&nbsp;AFIDA violation by removing the cap that currently&nbsp;prohibits the civil penalty from exceeding 25% of the fair market value of the interest in the agricultural land&nbsp;associated with the violation.Under an exception in the bill, the civil penalty for a foreign-owned shell corporation is 100% of the fair market value of the interest in the agricultural land. The bill defines&nbsp;a shell corporation to include a company, association, firm, partnership, society, joint stock company, trust, or estate that has no or nominal operations.  The penalty does not apply if the shell corporation remedies a defective filing or failure to file within 60 days of USDA providing notice.USDA must conduct annual compliance audits of at least 10% of the reports. Further, USDA must provide&nbsp;state and county-level personnel certain annual training.USDA must also annually conduct research and submit a report to Congress on foreign investment in agricultural land, including trends in the purchase of U.S. agricultural land by foreign-owned shell corporations. Dairy Business Innovation Act of 2025This bill increases the authorization of appropriations for the Dairy Business Innovation&nbsp;(DBI) Initiatives for each fiscal year. Under the Agricultural Marketing Service, the&nbsp;DBI Initiatives support dairy businesses in the development, production, marketing, and distribution of dairy products. The DBI Initiatives provide direct technical assistance and subawards to dairy businesses, including for niche dairy products and dairy products derived from cow milk, sheep milk, and goat milk. Country of Origin Labeling Requirement Act or the COOL Online Act  This bill requires sellers of imported products online to conspicuously disclose the country of origin of the products and the country where the seller's principal place of business is located.

Kids Online Safety ActThis bill requires covered online platforms, including social media platforms, to implement tools and safeguards to protect users and visitors under the age of 17. Covered platforms are online platforms, video games, messaging applications, or video streaming services used or likely to be used by individuals under the age of 17, with specified exceptions.&nbsp;The bill generally requires covered platforms to exercise reasonable care in the design and use of features that increase minors’ online activity in order to prevent and mitigate harm to minors (e.g., mental health disorders and severe harassment). &nbsp;Covered platforms are also required to provide certain safeguards to minors, such as protections for minors’ data; tools for parents of minors, such as access to minors’ privacy settings; and a mechanism for account&nbsp;holders and visitors to report harm to minors on the platform.&nbsp;Covered platforms are prohibited from conducting market or product research on children under the age of 13, and may only conduct such research on those under the age of 17 with parental consent.&nbsp;The bill provides for enforcement through the Federal Trade Commission and states.&nbsp;The bill also requires online platforms to meet certain requirements before using algorithms that select, order, or prioritize information presented to users based on user-specific data not provided for that purpose.

Interior and the Forest Service must approve extension requests in 90-day increments if U.S. Customs and Border Protection determines that operational control of the border area has not been achieved. National Human Trafficking Database ActThis bill establishes a framework to collect comprehensive data on human trafficking.At the federal level, the bill requires the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) within the Department of Justice to establish an online database that includes human trafficking data for each state.At the state level, the bill authorizes grants for covered state agencies (e.g., a state bureau of investigation or similar law enforcement agency) to collect and report human trafficking data to the OVC. Stopping the Abuse, Victimization, and Exploitation of Girls Act or the SAVE Girls Act This bill authorizes the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services to provide grants to certain governmental and nongovernmental organizations to combat the smuggling and trafficking of children and young women.  The focus of this grant program is (1) preventing the smuggling of children and women between the ages of 12 and 24 across the U.S. border; and (2) providing support to such individuals if they have already been smuggled into the United States or if they have been or are at risk of becoming victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons, including child sex trafficking.  Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal Act of 2025 or the CLEAR Act of 2025This bill establishes requirements and programs related to the detention of individuals unlawfully present in the United States and facing removal, including the role of state and local governments in this process.The bill provides that state and local governments have the authority to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, including by apprehending individuals and transferring them to federal custody.

Fair Play for Girls ActThis bill requires the Department of Justice to report to Congress on violence against females in athletics in the United States. Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens ActThis bill establishes certain criminal grounds for making non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) inadmissible and expands the crimes for which a non-U.S. national is deportable.First, the bill establishes that a non-U.S. national is inadmissible if the individual has admitted to or is convicted of acts constituting the essential elements of stalking, child abuse, child neglect, child abandonment, a sex offense, conspiracy to commit a sex offense, a violation of certain protection orders, or domestic violence (including physical or sexual abuse or a pattern of coercive behavior when it occurs within certain close relationships).&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the bill establishes additional grounds for deportation. Under current law, a non-U.S. national is deportable for certain criminal convictions, including domestic violence, stalking, and child abuse. The bill makes any sex offense (including crimes against minors) or conspiracy to commit a sex offense a basis for deportation. The bill also expands the domestic violence crimes that make a non-U.S. national deportable to include physical or sexual abuse or a pattern of coercive behavior when it occurs within certain close relationships. Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2025This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish specific billing codes under Medicare for certain materials used in ultralightweight manual wheelchairs.Specifically, the CMS must establish at least two billing codes for the base of the wheelchair, with at least one code for a base with titanium or carbon fiber construction material and at least one code for a base without these materials. Suppliers receive the same payment under Medicare for these wheelchairs as would otherwise apply, but may bill beneficiaries for any difference between the payment and the actual charge for the wheelchair. The CMS may require suppliers to inform beneficiaries of their potential financial liability in these cases. Access to Pediatric Technologies Act of 2025This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish, upon request, specific payment methodologies for qualifying pediatric technologies under the Medicare physician fee schedule.&nbsp;Qualifying pediatric technologies are medical devices that are (1) covered under Medicare, (2) approved by the Food and Drug Administration, (3) currently billed using a specified temporary billing code for emerging technologies, and (4) predominantly used or specifically designated for pediatric patients.The CMS must develop a payment methodology for a qualifying pediatric technology upon request from the manufacturer and based on available data, including pricing information and claims data. Manufacturers must include relevant information in their requests to enable the CMS to develop the corresponding methodologies. Make the Migrant Protection Protocols Mandatory Act of 2025This bill requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to remove certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) from the United States while such an individual's application for admission is pending.Specifically, if such an individual arrived by land from a foreign country bordering the United States and the individual is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to admission into the United States, DOJ must return that individual to that bordering foreign country while the individual's application for admission is pending. (Currently, DOJ may choose to detain such an individual or return the individual to the bordering foreign country while the application for admission is pending.) Fostering Autonomy in Independent Returns by Prohibiting Redundant and Extralegal Programs Act of 2025 or the FAIR PREP Act of 2025This bill prohibits the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from preparing federal tax returns or refund claims, with some exceptions. The bill specifically prohibits the preparation of federal income tax returns or refund claims through the IRS’s Direct File program. (The Direct File program currently allows qualified taxpayers in 25 participating states to prepare and electronically file free federal tax returns through a portal on the IRS’s website.)The bill defines prepare with respect to federal tax returns and refund claims as (1) the completion (in whole or in part) of any form or schedule for the purpose of calculating federal taxes or refunds, and (2) the filing (either electronically or on paper) of such federal tax returns or refund claims.However, under the bill, federal and state tax returns and refund claims may be prepared through the IRS’s Free File program (a program that allows certain taxpayers to prepare and file free federal and state income tax returns&nbsp;using third-party tax-preparation software) or the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance grant program (through which the IRS partners with local community organizations to help low-income and disabled individuals and persons with limited English proficiency prepare and file free federal and state&nbsp;income tax returns). Further, the Department of the Treasury may not award grants or enter into contracts&nbsp;or other transactions for the development or operation of an electronic tax preparation service.&nbsp;&nbsp; This resolution recognizes October 10, 2025, as American Girls in Sports Day. The resolution also calls on sports-governing bodies in the United States and abroad to protect biological women and girls in sports. End Child Trafficking Now ActThis bill imposes restrictions related to adult non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) being admitted into the United States with a minor.Such an adult may not be admitted with a minor unless the adult (1) presents documents and witness testimony proving that the adult is a relative or guardian of the minor, or (2) submits to a DNA test that proves such a relationship. The Department of Homeland Security may request a DNA test only if the required relationship cannot be established by the presented documents and witness testimony. An adult who does not consent to a requested DNA test shall be inadmissible.If the required relationship cannot be established and the immigration officer believes the adult is guilty of a felony offense, the officer may arrest the adult.The bill makes it a crime for an adult to knowingly use a minor to whom the adult is not a relative or guardian to enter the United States. American Music Fairness Act This bill establishes that the copyright holder of a sound recording shall have the exclusive right to perform the sound recording through an audio transmission. (Currently, the public performance right only covers performances through a digital audio transmission in certain instances, which means that nonsubscription terrestrial radio stations generally do not have to get a license to publicly perform a copyright-protected sound recording.) Under the bill, a nonsubscription broadcast transmission must have a license to publicly perform such sound recordings. The Copyright Royalty Board must periodically determine the royalty rates for such a license. When determining the rates, the board must base its decision on certain information presented by the parties, including the radio stations' effect on other streams of revenue related to the sound recordings.  Terrestrial broadcast stations (and the owners of such stations) that fall below certain revenue thresholds may pay certain flat fees, instead of the board-established rate, for a license to publicly perform copyright-protected sound recordings. Preventing the Recycling of Immigrants is Necessary for Trafficking Suspension Act or the PRINTS ActThis bill addresses migrant minor children entering the United States. Specifically, the bill makes it a crime for a person to knowingly use a minor to gain entry to the United States if the minor is not a close relative or if the person is not the minor’s guardian. In addition, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) must fingerprint all non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) entering the United States who are younger than 14 years of age if a CBP officer suspects that the child is victim of human trafficking.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must share with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) any fingerprints collected under this bill from an unaccompanied child if that child is transferred to HHS custody.DHS must report to Congress on the number of children fingerprinted annually under this bill. DHS must also publish on a monthly basis the number of individuals apprehended for falsely claiming a child accompanying them into the United States was a close relative. &nbsp; Sustainable Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Services in the Home Act This bill permanently allows services relating to cardiac rehabilitation programs, intensive cardiac rehabilitation programs, and pulmonary rehabilitation programs to be furnished via telehealth at a beneficiary's home under Medicare.  Veterans Health Care Freedom ActThis bill requires the Center for Innovation for Care and Payment within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement a three-year pilot program to provide veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system with the ability to choose health care providers through the covered care system. Under the bill, the covered care system includes VA medical facilities, health care providers participating in the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP), and eligible entities or providers that have entered into a Veterans Care Agreement.A veteran participating in the program may elect to receive care at any provider in the covered care system.The pilot program removes certain requirements (e.g., location of the veteran) to access care at VA and non-VA facilities. After four years, the bill permanently phases out the requirements for accessing care under the VCCP and Veterans Care Agreements and requires the VA to provide such care under the same conditions of the pilot program. Additionally, after four years, veterans may receive care at a VA medical facility regardless of whether the facility is in the same Veterans Integrated Service Network as the veteran. Removing Our Unsecure Technologies to Ensure Reliability and Security Act or the ROUTERS ActThis bill requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, to conduct a study on the national security risks posed by consumer routers and modems (including devices that combine a modem and router) and provide the results of the study to Congress. The study must address devices developed, manufactured, or supplied&nbsp;by persons (i.e., individuals and entities)&nbsp;owned by, controlled by, or subject to the influence of China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp; American Music Tourism Act of 2025This bill directs the National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) of the Department of Commerce to promote tourism to music-related and sports attractions.The bill requires NTTO to promote domestic and international travel and tourism to&nbsp;U.S. music festivals, concert venues, and other music-related attractions and locations. The bill also expands NTTO's current mandate to facilitate sports and recreation events and activities to include the&nbsp;promotion of international travel and tourism to such activities in the United States.NTTO must report its activities and findings to Congress within one year after the bill's enactment and, thereafter, every two years.&nbsp; This resolution&nbsp;calls on the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to revoke its transgender student-athlete eligibility policy and urges the NCAA to require its member conferences to conform to a biological sex-based policy across all sports and all divisions."

Repair Abuses of MSP Payments Act or the RAMP Act This bill restricts the private right of action against insurance plans that do not provide appropriate primary payment in cases in which Medicare is a secondary payer. Current law allows for a private right of action against primary plans that do not provide appropriate primary payment in cases in which Medicare is a secondary payer; this provision applies to group health plans, workers' compensation plans, automobile or liability insurance plans, and no-fault insurance plans. The bill limits this provision to group health plans. Medicare Audiology Access Improvement Act of 2025This bill provides for Medicare coverage of certain audiology services. Specifically, the bill expands coverage to include diagnostic and treatment services that are furnished by audiologists and that would otherwise be covered if provided by a physician, including incidental services, regardless of whether such services are provided pursuant to a referral from, or under the supervision of, a physician or other health care practitioner. Transparency In Charges for Key Events Ticketing Act or the TICKET ActThis bill requires ticket sellers (including sellers on the secondary market) for concerts, performances, sporting events, and similar activities to clearly and prominently disclose the total ticket price for the event&nbsp;at the time the ticket is first displayed to an individual (and anytime thereafter during the purchasing process). Prior to completing a purchase, ticket sellers also must provide an itemized list of the base ticket price and each fee (e.g., service fee, processing fee, or other charge). The total ticket price must also be disclosed in any advertisement, marketing, or price list.Additionally, a ticket seller, secondary market seller, or ticket exchange that does not have actual or constructive possession of an event ticket is prohibited from selling or advertising a ticket for the event. However, a secondary market seller or exchange may sell or advertise a service to obtain an event ticket for an individual&nbsp;if the seller or exchange (1) does not market the service as an event ticket, (2) maintains a clear separation between the provided service and the event tickets throughout the entire purchasing process, and (3) clearly discloses that the service is not an event ticket.The bill establishes additional disclosure requirements for&nbsp;ticket sellers, secondary market sellers, and ticket exchanges, and requires such entities to issue a refund for the total ticket price if an event is canceled or postponed.The Federal Trade Commission must enforce these requirements. Prevent Interruptions in Physical Therapy Act of 2025This bill allows a physical therapist to receive payment under Medicare for services provided to the physical therapist's patients by another physical therapist through a qualifying temporary arrangement, regardless of the geographic area or population served. Currently, physical therapists may only receive payment with respect to such arrangements for services provided in medically underserved, rural, or health professional shortage areas. Leveraging Integrity and Verification of Eligibility for Beneficiaries Act or the LIVE Beneficiaries ActThis bill requires state Medicaid programs to check the Social Security Administration's Death Master File on at least a quarterly basis to determine whether Medicaid enrollees are deceased. Student Visa Security Improvement ActThis bill establishes new requirements for foreign student visas and participating educational institutions.&nbsp;The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must review the applications of student visa applicants and conduct in-person interviews when appropriate to determine whether they are inadmissible due to terrorist-related activities.

Further, individuals may claim a deduction for qualified hurricane disaster contributions even if they do not itemize their tax deductions.The bill defines qualified hurricane disaster contributions, as charitable contributions for Hurricanes Helene and Milton relief efforts made on or after September 28, 2024, and before December 31, 2025.&nbsp;The bill also&nbsp;eliminates the 10% penalty on early distributions from a qualified retirement plan for up to $100,000 of qualified hurricane disaster distributions to an eligible individual,allows eligible individuals to include qualified hurricane disaster distributions in income over three years, andincreases the loan amount that may be borrowed from a qualified retirement plan to $100,000 and allows such loans to be repaid over a longer time period.An eligible individual is an individual whose principal home during the incident&nbsp;period was in a qualified hurricane disaster area and who sustained economic loss due to Hurricanes Helene or Milton.Finally, the bill allows eligible individuals to calculate the&nbsp;EITC for the 2024 tax year using 2023 earned income.&nbsp; This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to develop a strategy to align its obesity-related programs with the classification of obesity as a medically accepted disease. Additionally, DOD must conduct an educational campaign to promote awareness, diagnosis, and treatment of obesity as a disease in the Armed Forces (the&nbsp;Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force).The bill also requires DOD to include information regarding unmet weight standards in any reports it submits to Congress regarding&nbsp;disqualifications for enlistment in, disabilities incurred in, or medical discharges from the Armed Forces.DOD must submit a report to Congress on the effects of obesity on the readiness of the Armed Forces, including legislative recommendations to address such effects.

Lung Cancer Screening and Prevention Act of 2025This bill authorizes Medicare coverage of additional types of lung cancer screening tests that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, regardless of whether they are recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must set coverage and payment limits for such tests. (Currently, Medicare covers screening tests for the early detection of lung cancer if they are recommended by the task force.) Enhancing Domestic Drug Manufacturing Competitiveness ActThis bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study and report to Congress on key regulatory barriers to pharmaceutical manufacturing in the United States.&nbsp;Specifically, GAO must identify and assess, including by engaging stakeholders, barriers that impede expansion or siting of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the United States or make the United States less competitive than other countries as a location for such facilities. GAO must consider (1) whether environmental or other regulations significantly delay and increase the cost of expanding or siting pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the United States; (2) the potential impact of environmental and other regulations on pharmaceutical supply chain resiliency; and (3) specific actions for regulators to address the identified barriers.&nbsp;Finally, the report must include recommendations for streamlining regulatory barriers and facilitating technological solutions to foster U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturing.&nbsp; Curbing Realistic Exploitative Electronic Pedophilic Robots Act 2.0 or the CREEPER Act 2.0 This bill establishes new federal criminal offenses for conduct involving child sex dolls.  Specifically, it makes it a crime to import, transport, buy, sell, distribute, or possess a child sex doll. A violator is subject to criminal penalties—a fine, a prison term, or both.  Performing Artist Tax Parity Act of 2025This bill increases the income limit and makes other modifications to the above-the-line tax deduction for business expenses of qualified performing artists. (Above-the-line deductions are subtracted from gross income to calculate adjusted gross income.)Under current law, a qualified performing artist (who may deduct certain business expenses from gross income) is defined as an individual who (1) performs services in the performing arts as an employee for at least two employers during the tax year and receives at least $200 from each employer (minimum payment), (2) has business deductions attributable to such services exceeding 10% of the gross income received from such services, and (3) has adjusted gross income of $16,000 or less.The bill modifies the definition of a qualified performing artist (for purposes of the business expense deduction) to eliminate the $16,000 adjusted gross income limitation and increase the minimum payment amount to $500 (adjusted for inflation beginning in 2026).However, under the bill, the tax deduction for business expenses of qualified performing artists phases out for individuals with gross income exceeding $100,000 (or $200,000 for joint filers) such that the tax deduction completely phases out for individuals with gross income exceeding $120,000 (or $240,000 for joint filers). (The phase-out threshold is adjusted for inflation beginning in 2026.)Finally, the bill provides that commissions paid to a manager or agent by a qualified performing artist are deductible business expenses. Health Care Efficiency Through Flexibility ActThis bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to delay certain requirements relating to the reporting of quality measures by accountable care organizations (ACOs) and to also test alternative reporting methods for ACOs.Specifically, the CMS must delay the requirement that ACOs use a specified electronic system for reporting quality measures until January 1, 2030. Additionally, the CMS must establish a pilot program to test other digital reporting methods; ACOs that participate in the pilot program are exempt from using the existing electronic system.&nbsp;The CMS must also implement standards for digital reporting by January 1, 2030, that ensure all electronic health record systems used by ACOs are able to support reporting across a range of practice sizes, specialties, and geographic locations. ACOs may use existing reporting methods until the standards are implemented. Veterans Nutrition and Wellness Act of 2025This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish and implement the Food is Medicine pilot program, under which the VA must provide medically&nbsp;tailored meals and groceries, nutrition education, and cooking classes to certain veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system. Specifically, the program is for veterans enrolled in the VA health care system who receive VA care for (1) multiple chronic conditions, or (2) maternal health and are at risk of&nbsp;preeclampsia or gestational diabetes.The three-year pilot program also requires the VA to (1) develop and seek to implement training programs for VA health care providers in integrating the program into the treatment plans of veterans, and (2) seek to collaborate with community-based organizations to procure&nbsp;locally&nbsp;sourced produce and expand the availability of medically&nbsp;tailored meals and groceries. Maximizing Israel-U.S. Research Advancement and Collaborative Leadership in Emerging Medical Technology Act of 2025 or the MIRACLE Medical Technology Act of 2025This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement a program for the United States and Israel to collaborate on developing and delivering health care products and services. The program must include coordinated activities in specified areas, including research and development, use of innovative technology, intellectual property protection, regulatory harmonization, disease prevention, and biological product manufacturing. The bill authorizes&nbsp;HHS to establish a joint United States-Israel Health Care Collaboration Center in the United States to leverage existing expertise for advancing the program’s purposes. Save America's Forgotten Equines Act of 2025 or the SAFE Act of 2025This bill permanently prohibits the slaughter of equines (e.g., horses and mules) for human consumption.&nbsp;(Current law prohibits the slaughter of dogs and cats for human consumption. This bill extends the prohibition to equines.)Specifically, this bill prohibits a person from knowingly (1)&nbsp;slaughtering an equine for human consumption; or&nbsp;(2) shipping, transporting, possessing, purchasing, selling, or donating an equine to be slaughtered for human consumption or equine parts for human consumption.The bill subjects a violator to a fine.The bill applies to conduct in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. However, it does not apply to an activity carried out by an Indian for a religious ceremony.As background, in recent years, the appropriations acts have prohibited the Department of Agriculture (USDA) from using federal funds to inspect horses before they are slaughtered for human consumption. Therefore, there are currently no USDA-inspected horse slaughter facilities in the United States. Veterans Mental Health Crisis Referral Enhancement Act of 2025This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement a three-year pilot program under which Vet Centers and VA medical facilities provide veterans who are experiencing mental health crises with referrals to approved non-VA mental health care providers.The VA must&nbsp;report on the implementation, outcomes, and effectiveness of the pilot program. No Tax on Tips ActThis bill establishes a new tax deduction of up to $25,000 for tips, subject to limitations. The bill also expands the business tax credit for the portion of payroll taxes an employer pays on certain tips to include payroll taxes paid on tips received in connection with certain beauty services.Under the bill, the new tax deduction for tips is limited to cash tips (1) received by an employee during the course of employment in an occupation that customarily receives tips, and (2) reported by the employee to the employer for purposes of withholding payroll taxes. (Under current law, an employee is required to report tips exceeding $20 per month to their employer.)Further, an employee with compensation exceeding a specified threshold ($160,000&nbsp;in 2025 and adjusted annually for inflation) in the prior tax year may not claim the new tax deduction for tips.Finally, the bill expands the business tax credit for the portion of payroll taxes that an employer pays on certain tips to include payroll taxes paid on tips received in connection with barbering and hair care, nail care, esthetics, and body and spa treatments. (Under current law, an employer is allowed a business tax credit for the amount of payroll taxes paid on certain tips received by an employee in connection with providing, delivering, or serving food or beverages.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Thin Blue Line Act This bill expands the list of statutory aggravating factors in death penalty determinations to also include killing or targeting a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder. Chronic Disease Flexible Coverage ActThis bill provides statutory authority for guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that expands the types of preventive care that may be offered under a high deductible health plan (HDHP) without requiring a deductible&nbsp;or with a deductible below the minimum threshold.Under current law, to be considered health savings account-eligible, an HDHP must have a deductible above a certain minimum threshold amount, which is adjusted annually. However, an HDHP may cover certain types of preventive care without requiring a deductible or with a deductible below the minimum threshold.&nbsp;The IRS issued guidance expanding the types of preventive care that may be covered by an HDHP without requiring a deductible or with a deductible below the minimum threshold to includeangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for individuals with congestive heart failure, diabetes, or coronary artery disease;anti-resorptive therapy for individuals with osteoporosis or&nbsp;osteopenia;beta-blockers for individuals with congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease;blood pressure monitors for individuals with hypertension;inhaled&nbsp;corticosteroids and peak flow meters for individuals with asthma;insulin and other glucose lowering agents, retinopathy screening,&nbsp;glucometers, and hemoglobin A1c testing for individuals with diabetes;international normalized ratio testing for individuals with liver disease or bleeding disorders;low-density lipoprotein testing for individuals with heart disease;statins for individuals with heart disease or diabetes; andselective&nbsp;serotonin reuptake inhibitors for individuals with depression.&nbsp;The bill provides statutory authority for the IRS's guidance.&nbsp; Manatee Protection Act of 2025This bill requires the Department of the Interior to include the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) in the endangered species list and give the species protections provided to endangered species. Sunshine Protection Act of 2025This bill makes daylight saving time the new, permanent standard time.States with areas exempt from daylight saving time may choose the standard time for those areas. Protecting our Communities from Sexual Predators ActThis bill requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to detain certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who have been arrested for sexual assault. The bill also provides for the inadmissibility and deportability of certain individuals convicted of sexual assault.Under this bill, the DOJ must detain an individual who (1) is unlawfully present in the United States, made certain misrepresentations, or did not possess the necessary documents when applying for admission; and (2) has been charged with, arrested for, convicted of, or admits to having committed acts which constitute the essential elements of, an offense involving sexual assault.The bill also establishes under statute that a conviction for certain crimes related to sexual assault shall be grounds for (1) barring an individual from entering the United States, and (2) deportability. (Under current law, convictions for certain crimes, including crimes involving moral turpitude, are grounds for inadmissibility and deportability.)&nbsp; Veteran Overmedication and Suicide Prevention Act of 2025This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to report on the deaths of covered veterans who died by suicide during the last five years, regardless of whether information relating to such deaths has been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A covered veteran is any veteran who received VA hospital care or medical services during the five-year period preceding the veteran's death.Among other elements, the report shall include the total number of covered veterans who died by suicide, violent death, or accidental death, as well as certain demographic information. This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment prohibiting total outlays for a fiscal year from exceeding total receipts for that fiscal year unless Congress authorizes the excess by a two-thirds vote of each chamber. The prohibition excludes outlays for repayment of debt principal and receipts derived from borrowing.  The amendment prohibits total outlays for any fiscal year from exceeding 18% of the gross domestic product of the United States unless two-thirds of each chamber of Congress provides for a specific increase above this amount.  The amendment requires a two-thirds vote of each chamber of Congress to impose a new tax, increase the statutory rate of any tax, or increase the aggregate amount of revenue. It requires a three-fifths vote of each chamber to increase the limit on the debt of the United States.  The President must submit an annual budget in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts or 18% of the gross domestic product of the United States.  The amendment prohibits a court from ordering a revenue increase to enforce the requirements.  Congress may waive specified requirements when a declaration of war is in effect or the United States is engaged in a military conflict that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security.

This bill establishes forest management requirements for federal lands, particularly with respect to reducing wildfires.&nbsp;For example, the bill establishes annual goals to increase (1) the number of acres of Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land that are mechanically thinned (i.e., a management process related to the removal of trees and vegetation); and (2) the number of acres of Forest Service and BLM land treated by prescribed fire. By FY2029, the goals must be to increase the number of acres of each by at least 40% compared to the average number of acres of each in FY2019-FY2023.The bill also directs the Forest Service and the BLM to (1) implement standardized procedures for tracking data relating to hazardous fuels reduction activities they carry out, and (2) develop a strategy to identify opportunities to use livestock grazing as a wildfire risk reduction tool on federal land. Additionally, the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior must establish a deployment and test bed pilot program for wildfire prevention, detection, communication, and mitigation technologies.The bill mandates use of existing authorities for expedited environmental review for certain forest land at high risk from wildfire, insects, or disease.Finally, the bill provides local governments and Indian tribes the right to intervene in lawsuits concerning certain projects on federal land that (1) reduce risks posed by wildfire, insects, or disease; or (2) generate revenue from harvesting timber.

Additionally, the bill removes the requirement that an individual be board-certified to receive reimbursement. The VA may adjust the amount of the reimbursement, so long as the adjustment does not result in a reimbursement of less than $2,000 per year for each specified position.

Veterans Infertility Treatment Act of 2025This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish infertility treatments, standard fertility preservation services, or both to a covered veteran or partner of a covered veteran. A covered veteran is a veteran who is enrolled in the VA health care system and has infertility or is at risk of having infertility, as determined by a licensed physician.The VA may furnish up to three completed in vitro fertilization cycles that result in live birth, or 10 attempted cycles, whichever occurs first. Additionally, the VA may furnish in vitro fertilization treatment using donated gametes or embryos.The VA must receive consent to furnish an in vitro fertilization cycle from the covered veteran, the partner of a covered veteran, and the third-party donor (if applicable).For purposes of paying travel expenses for treatment or services to the partner of a covered veteran, the VA must deem the partner to be a veteran receiving treatment or care.The VA must prescribe regulations related to the provision of infertility treatments and standard fertility preservation services as required by this bill.Prior to the enactment of such regulations, the VA must ensure that (1) counseling and treatment furnished under existing authority is available to a veteran and the veteran's partner, regardless of whether they are married; and (2) treatment under existing authority may be furnished using donated gametes or embryos.

The amount of the deduction may not exceed 15% of the individual’s regular wages from the same employer. Further, the deduction is not allowed for individuals with annual adjusted gross&nbsp;income exceeding $100,000 (or $150,000 for heads of the household and $200,000 for married couples filing a joint return).&nbsp;&nbsp; Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements Needed for Veterans Act or the CHIP IN for Veterans ActThis bill makes permanent, starting December 16, 2026, the pilot program under which the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may accept donations of property or facilities from certain nonfederal entities (e.g., state authorities or private entities).

         "No Tax Dollars for College Encampments Act of 2025This bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student aid programs to report incidents of civil disturbance.&nbsp;Specifically, the bill requires each&nbsp;IHE to include in its annual security report its current campus policies for responding to incidents of civil disturbance occurring on campus, including with respect to coordination of such response with state, local, and campus law enforcement. The bill defines the term incident of civil disturbance to mean a civil unrest activity (e.g., a demonstration, riot, or strike) that disrupts the community in which it is taking place and requires intervention to maintain public safety and prevent the disruption of learning.Additionally, the bill requires accrediting agencies to monitor an IHE's compliance with these reporting requirements. (Under current law, an IHE must be accredited by an accrediting agency to participate in federal student aid programs.) This resolution celebrates March 31, 2025, as the 100th anniversary of the Fort Wayne, Indiana radio station WOWO.&nbsp; Defund NPR ActThis bill prohibits federal funding of National Public Radio (NPR) or any successor organization.&nbsp;The prohibition includes the payment of dues to or the purchase of programming from NPR by a public broadcast station using federal funds.  Veterans Opportunity Act of 2025This bill establishes the Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition Administration to administer economic opportunity assistance programs for veterans and their dependents and survivors.Specifically, the Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition Administration must administer the following Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) programs:vocational rehabilitation and employment programs,educational assistance programs,veterans' housing loan and related programs,the responsibilities of the VA with respect to the&nbsp;Transition Assistance Program, andany other VA program that the VA determines is&nbsp;appropriate.Prior to the transfer of administrative responsibilities, the bill requires the VA to certify that (1) the transition of the provision of services will not negatively affect the provision of such services to veterans, and (2) such services are ready to be transferred. Review Every Veteran's Claim Act of 2025This bill prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from denying a claim for benefits on the sole basis that a veteran failed to appear for a medical examination provided by the VA in conjunction with the claim for benefits. Ensuring Veterans’ Final Resting Place Act of 2025This bill provides that the provision of an urn or commemorative plaque does not prohibit an individual from receiving a headstone or marker or other burial benefits (i.e., interment at a national cemetery) from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Under current law, individuals who request an urn or plaque do so in lieu of being furnished a headstone or burial benefit. Abortion Funding Awareness Act of 2025This bill establishes reporting requirements for states regarding certain Medicaid payments to abortion providers.Specifically, the bill requires states that make Medicaid payments using&nbsp;federal funds for any items or services furnished by an abortion provider to annually (1) submit a report to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services on all such payments, and (2) publish the report on the state's website. The report must include specified information, including the number of abortions performed by the providers and the gestational age with respect to each such abortion. (Current law restricts the use of federal funds for abortions to cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment of the woman. States may use their own funds to cover abortions in other cases.) Fairness in Veterans’ Education Act of 2025This bill modifies the process for repaying service members and veterans who paid to keep benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill, but later chose to utilize Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Specifically, the bill removes the requirement for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to issue the repayments with the last monthly housing stipend under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. This requirement has limited the repayments to individuals who are receiving stipends. Under the bill, the VA must make such a repayment before the exhaustion of the individual's entitlement to education assistance. Maintaining American Superiority by Improving Export Control Transparency ActThis bill requires the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to annually report to Congress on export control licensing.Under current law, BIS administers and enforces controls on the export of dual-use goods (e.g., items with both civilian and military uses) and certain military parts and components. These export controls are implemented primarily under the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).Under this bill, BIS must annually report to Congress on license applications, enforcement actions, and other requests for authorization for the export, reexport, release, and in-country transfer of items subject to the&nbsp;EAR to covered entities. A covered entity is any entity that (1) is located or operating in a country listed in Country Group D:5 (countries that are identified by the Department of State as subject to U.S. arms embargoes), and (2) is included on the Entity List or the Military End-User List (two of the lists published by BIS containing information on the individuals, organizations, and addresses subject to restrictions involving items subject to the EAR).The bill requires this report to include specified information, such as the name of the entity submitting the application, where the item is being exported, the decision with respect to the license application or authorization, and information on related enforcement activities to ensure&nbsp;compliance with U.S. export controls. The information shall be exempt from public disclosure (except for aggregate statistics). Fortifying Refrigeration Infrastructure and Developing Global Exports Act of 2025 or the FRIDGE Act of 2025 This bill expands the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program to include funding for technical assistance for infrastructure-related projects to ensure U.S. agricultural commodities are not damaged or lost due to infrastructure deficiencies in new and developing markets. This Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) program funds projects that address long-term opportunities to reduce foreign import constraints or expand export growth opportunities.Specifically, the bill directs FAS to enter into contracts or other agreements with trade organizations to enhance the infrastructure capabilities (including cold chain capacity and port improvements) in new and developing foreign markets through needs assessments, training, and other technical assistance. End Unaccountable Amnesty ActThis bill revises, restricts, and repeals various laws and programs addressing the admissibility and deportability of certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law). The bill includes changes to the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, the treatment of unaccompanied children, and removal proceedings.Under current law, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may grant a foreign state Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which protects qualified nationals of that foreign state from removal from the United States. The bill instead requires an act of Congress to grant TPS to a foreign state. The bill limits TPS status to 12 months, subject to extension.The bill also generally requires the return of unaccompanied inadmissible children to their country of nationality or last habitual residence, among other changes. Under current law,&nbsp;DHS is authorized (not required) to return these children, and only if their country of nationality or last habitual residence is contiguous to the United States.The bill also repeals the law allowing for the cancellation of removal or adjustment of the immigration status of qualifying&nbsp;non-U.S. nationals.&nbsp;Under the bill, certain forms of identification, including a Notice to Appear issued by&nbsp;DHS, are no longer valid documents for purposes of airport security checkpoints.The bill also limits the ability of&nbsp;DHS to grant parole (temporary admission granted on a case-by-case basis). For example, the bill limits the granting of parole to a list of specific situations, such as the imminent death of a close family member. Border Security is National Security ActThis bill authorizes appropriations through FY2028 for the Department of Defense to provide border security support to the Department of Homeland Security. Qualified Immunity Act of 2025This bill provides statutory authority for qualified immunity for law enforcement officers in civil cases involving constitutional violations.Current law provides a statutory civil cause of action against state and local government actors (e.g., law enforcement officers) for violations of constitutional rights, also known as Section 1983 lawsuits. The Supreme Court has also found an implied cause of action against federal law enforcement officers in certain situations (e.g., Fourth Amendment violations), also known as Bivens lawsuits. However, under the judicial doctrine of qualified immunity, government officials performing discretionary duties are generally shielded from civil liability, unless their actions violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known.The bill provides statutory authority for these principles with respect to law enforcement officers. Specifically, under the bill, law enforcement officers are entitled to qualified immunity if (1) at the time of the alleged violation, the constitutional right at issue was not clearly established or the state of the law was not sufficiently clear that any reasonable officer would have&nbsp;known that the conduct was unconstitutional; or (2) a court has held that the specific conduct at issue is constitutional.The bill applies to federal, state, and local law enforcement officers. It also specifies that law enforcement agencies and local governments may not be held liable if their officers are entitled to qualified immunity."

         "This bill provides statutory authority for&nbsp;Executive Order 14096, which was issued on April 26, 2023, to advance a government-wide approach to environmental justice, including by directing each federal agency to (1) make achieving environmental justice part of its mission, (2) issue an&nbsp;Environmental Justice Strategic Plan every four years, and (3) provide public notice of certain toxic chemical releases. The Executive Order also established the White House&nbsp;Office of Environmental Justice as well as&nbsp;an&nbsp;Environmental Justice Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council. Children’s Health Insurance Program Permanency Act or the CHIPP Act This bill permanently extends the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and related measures, programs, and authorities.  Specifically, the bill permanently funds CHIP and related programs that support the development of child health quality measures and outreach and enrollment efforts. The bill also permanently authorizes the Medicaid and CHIP express lane eligibility option, which allows states to use information from designated programs (e.g., the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) to streamline eligibility determinations for children. Additionally, under the bill, states may expand eligibility to children whose family income exceeds the otherwise applicable limits. Prompt Approval of Safe Generic Drugs ActThis bill authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve certain applications to market a generic drug despite the omission of certain safety information from the generic drug's labeling.Specifically, the FDA may not deem an abbreviated application for approval of a generic drug ineligible for approval solely because the drug's labeling omits safety information that is protected under another drug's patent or exclusivity protections. Similarly, a drug that is approved under this bill may not be considered mislabeled for lacking such safety information.Generally, an abbreviated application, for the purposes of this bill, is one that (1) uses required information from studies not conducted by the applicant; or (2) seeks approval of a drug that is, for drug approval purposes, a duplicate of an already-approved drug (i.e., a generic drug). Currently,&nbsp;the labeling for such a generic drug must generally be identical to that of the already-approved drug. This bill provides an exception to that requirement under the specified circumstances.&nbsp;For any drug approved under this bill, the FDA must require the drug's labeling to include any safety information that is necessary to assure safe use."

The Department of Veterans Affairs must submit such GAO report to Congress. This bill allows the Bay Mills Indian Community of Michigan to transfer, lease, encumber, or otherwise convey its real property that is not held in trust by the United States. The United States shall not be held liable for any loss resulting from a transfer of real property by the tribe. Rural Broadband Window of Opportunity ActThis bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prioritize the processing of applications for certain rural broadband expansion projects that are located in areas with the shortest construction seasons (e.g., areas with long winters and heavy snowfall).Specifically, the FCC must prioritize processing such applications for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) Phase II auction, which aims to facilitate the provision of broadband service to&nbsp;areas&nbsp;that are&nbsp;partially served. (The RDOF program's first phase, which is focused on broadband service for wholly unserved areas, is underway.) Firearm Industry Non-Discrimination Act or the FIND Act This bill prohibits the federal government from entering into contracts with an entity that discriminates against firearm trade associations or businesses that deal in firearms, ammunition, or related products.  Specifically, the bill requires a federal agency to include in each contract for the procurement of goods or services awarded by the agency a clause requiring the prime contractor to certify that it (1) has no policy, practice, guidance, or directive that discriminates against a firearm entity or firearm trade association; and (2) will not adopt a policy, practice, guidance, or directive that discriminates against a firearm entity or firearm trade association during the term of the contract. The bill establishes (1) a similar requirement with respect to subcontracts, and (2) penalties for violations. The bill makes such prohibition inapplicable to a contract for the procurement of goods or services that is a sole-source contract.  Removing Extraneous Loopholes Insuring Every Veteran Emergency Act or the RELIEVE Act This bill expands eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reimbursement of emergency treatment for veterans who are treated in a non-VA facility. Specifically, the bill waives the requirement that a veteran must have received VA care within the 24-month period preceding the furnishing of emergency treatment if the veteran receives such emergency treatment within the 60-day period following their enrollment in the VA health care system. Rural 340B Access Act of 2025This bill makes rural emergency hospitals (REHs) eligible to purchase drugs from manufacturers at discounted prices by participating in the Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA’s) 340B drug pricing program. HRSA’s 340B program requires drug manufacturers that participate in the Medicaid program to sell certain outpatient drugs at discounted prices to entities listed as eligible under current law. Additionally, in 2020, Congress established REHs as a new Medicare provider designation for hospitals in rural areas providing emergency department services, observation care, and other outpatient medical and health services for which the annual per patient average length of stay does not exceed 24 hours. The bill adds qualifying REHs to the list of entities that are eligible to participate in the 340B program.&nbsp; Keweenaw Bay Indian Community Land Claim Settlement Act of 2025This bill directs the Department of the Interior to transfer funds to the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community (KBIC) in Baraga County, Michigan, in order to settle the KBIC's land claims and clear title to those lands.The KBIC may use these funds for any lawful purpose except to acquire land for gaming.

Additionally, the bill repeals various federal misdemeanor offenses (i.e., criminal offenses punishable by a maximum prison term of one year or less), including the following:&nbsp;writing a check for less than $1,selling oleomargarine or colored margarine unless it complies with packaging and labeling requirements and is served in a triangular shape,removing a stamp from a piece of mail,boarding a vessel without authorization before it has been completely moored, andusing the Capitol Grounds as a playground.&nbsp; Strong Sentences for Safer D.C. Streets ActThis bill establishes and increases mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment for specified crimes in the District of Columbia.First, the bill mandates a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for first-degree murder (currently, the mandatory minimum sentence is 30 years imprisonment and the maximum sentence is life imprisonment without parole). The bill also repeals provisions that prohibit the sentencing of individuals under the age of 18 to life imprisonment without parole for first-degree murder.The bill also establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment for second-degree murder,10 years imprisonment for kidnapping,25 years imprisonment for first- degree sexual abuse, and25 years imprisonment for rape.&nbsp;Finally, the bill increases the mandatory minimum sentence forfirst-degree burglary from 5 years to 10 years imprisonment,unarmed carjacking from 7 years to 10 years imprisonment,armed carjacking from 15 years to 20 years imprisonment, andrape with a prior conviction of a crime of violence from 7 years to 30 years imprisonment.

Thus, if the Internal Revenue Service recognizes an IHE as a tax-exempt nonprofit organization,&nbsp;then the Department of Education must also recognize the&nbsp;IHE as a nonprofit IHE. Guarding Religious And Career Education Act or the GRACE ActThis bill directs the Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) to eliminate its Office of Enforcement. On October 8, 2021, the FSA announced it was reestablishing the Office of Enforcement to strengthen oversight of and enforcement actions against&nbsp;postsecondary schools that participate in federal student loan, grant, and work-study programs. Knife Owners’ Protection Act of 2025This bill permits an individual to transport a knife between two places (e.g., states) where knife possession, carry, or transport is legal. The knife must be transported in&nbsp;compliance with the bill's&nbsp;accessibility and secure storage requirements, unless it is an emergency knife or tool designed to cut seat belts.An individual who is transporting a knife in compliance with this bill may not be arrested or detained for a knife violation unless there is probable cause to believe the individual failed to comply with the accessibility or&nbsp;secure storage requirements.

Specifically, it adopted the (1) 2021 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), which&nbsp;applies to single family homes and multifamily low-rise buildings up to three stories; and (2) 2019&nbsp;American National Standards Institute/American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers/Illuminating Electrical Society (ANSI/ASHRAE/IES) Standard 90.1, which&nbsp;applies to multifamily residential buildings with four or more stories. HUD and USDA must also revert to using the energy efficiency standards required before the determination.In addition, the bill prohibits HUD, USDA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs from taking actions or using federal funds to implement or enforce the determination or any substantially similar determination. It also prohibits the Federal Housing Finance Agency from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing a determination or rule relating to energy efficiency standards for single and multifamily housing.Finally, the bill prohibits HUD and USDA from adopting updates to the IECC or ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 in certain circumstances unless&nbsp;at least 26 states have adopted codes or standards that meet or exceed the update's requirements. Freedom for Families ActThis bill allows individuals to establish and contribute to a health savings account (HSA) without being enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), increases HSA contribution limits, and allows tax-free distributions from an HSA during a period of qualified caregiving.Under current law, individuals may establish and contribute to an HSA if they are covered under an HSA-eligible HDHP. For 2025, HSA contributions are limited to $4,300 for self-only coverage or $8,550 for family coverage (adjusted annually).

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, the Federal Family Education Loan Program, and the Federal Perkins Loan Program.&nbsp;The bill also requires the Office of Government Ethics to submit an annual report to Congress that contains (1) the total amount owed by all covered employees, and (2) the name of any covered employee who failed to report the required information.&nbsp;  Stopping Border Surges Act This bill modifies immigration law provisions relating to unaccompanied alien minors and to asylum seekers.The bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to repatriate certain unaccompanied, inadmissible alien children, generally those not at risk of being trafficking victims nor having a fear of persecution. Currently, only inadmissible unaccompanied aliens from neighboring countries are subject to repatriation, and DHS has discretion whether to repatriate.When the Department of Health and Human Services releases an unaccompanied child to an individual, it shall provide DHS with certain information about that individual, including Social Security number and immigration status.The bill requires a stricter standard to find a credible fear of persecution and imposes additional rules on credible fear interviews.If an alien is granted asylum because of fear of persecution in a country, the alien shall be deemed to have renounced asylum status by returning to that country, if there has been no change in the country's conditions.The bill also (1) expands the definition of what constitutes a frivolous asylum application, (2) imposes additional limitations on eligibility for asylum, (3) shortens the deadline for applying for asylum, and (4) extends the time period an alien seeking asylum must wait before receiving employment authorization.Any individual who knowingly and willfully makes materially false statements or uses fraudulent documents in asylum-related proceedings shall be fined or imprisoned up to 10 years, or both.

No Vaccine Passports Act This bill prohibits certain actions related to vaccine passports and proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Specifically, a federal agency may not issue a vaccine passport, vaccine pass, or other standardized documentation for the purpose of certifying the COVID-19 vaccination status of a U.S. citizen to a third party, or otherwise publish or share any COVID-19 vaccination record of a U.S. citizen or similar health information.

Specifically, the bill exempts individuals from the requirement to maintain minimum essential health care coverage if they reside in a county where fewer than two health insurers offer insurance on the health insurance exchange. Under current law, there is no penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential health care coverage. The bill also requires certain executive branch and congressional employees to participate in health insurance exchanges. Under current law, Members of Congress and their designated staff are required to obtain coverage through health insurance exchanges, rather than the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. Current regulations authorize government contributions toward such coverage and require Members of Congress to designate which members of their staff are required to obtain coverage through an exchange. The bill requires all congressional staff, including employees of congressional committees and leadership offices, to obtain coverage through an exchange. The bill also prohibits Members of Congress from having the discretion to determine which of their employees are eligible to enroll through an exchange. Further, the President, Vice President, and executive branch political appointees must also obtain coverage through exchanges, rather than FEHB. The government is prohibited from contributing to or subsidizing the health insurance coverage of the officials and employees subject to this requirement, including Members of Congress and their staff. Congressional Border Security Assessment ActThis bill grants Members of Congress and their accompanying staff lawful access to Indian reservations for the purpose of assessing national security, public safety, and the security of the border. Specifically, the bill applies to an Indian reservation that includes 50 or more contiguous miles of the U.S.-Mexico border.&nbsp; Midnight Rules Relief ActThis bill allows Congress to disapprove multiple regulations under one joint resolution of disapproval if the regulations were submitted for review during a portion  of the final year of a President's term. Under current law, the Congressional Review Act generally&nbsp;provides for a period of additional review during the succeeding Congress for regulations that were submitted during the last 60 legislative days of the prior Congress. However, each joint resolution may disapprove of only one regulation. No SmartPay for Anti-2A Companies ActThis bill prohibits the General Services Administration from awarding a contract under the SmartPay Program for the procurement of a commercial payment system that uses a payment processing agency that has implemented a merchant category code for gun retailers. Less Imprecision in Species Treatment Act of 2025 or the LIST Act of 2025This bill modifies the process for removing a species from the endangered or threatened species lists and makes related requirements.&nbsp;A species must be removed from the endangered or threatened species lists if the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service produces or receives substantial scientific or commercial information demonstrating that the species is recovered or that recovery goals set for the species have been met.The publication and notice of a proposed regulation to remove a species from the lists must consist solely of a notice of the removal.The bill establishes a process for removing species from the lists if they were erroneously or wrongfully listed. The bill prohibits a person from submitting a petition to list a species as a threatened or endangered species for 10 years if the person knowingly submitted a petition with information that was inaccurate beyond scientifically reasonable margins of error, fraudulent, or misrepresentative. Strategic Production Response and Implementation ActThis bill modifies the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to prohibit&nbsp;the Department of Energy (DOE) from drawing down petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until DOE develops and implements a plan to increase the percentage of federal lands leased for oil and gas production. The increase must be equal to&nbsp;the percentage of petroleum in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that is to be drawn down. However, the bill does not apply to a  drawdown of&nbsp;petroleum products in the case of a severe energy supply interruption, which is permitted under current law.&nbsp;The plan must not provide for a total increase in the percentage of federal lands leased for oil and gas production in excess of 10%. American Sovereignty and Species Protection Act of 2025This bill limits the protection of endangered or threatened species to species that are native to the United States. In addition, the bill prohibits certain funding for endangered or threatened species from being used to acquire lands, waters, or other interests in foreign countries. Travel Mask Mandate Repeal Act of 2025This bill prohibits federal agencies from imposing a mandate related to COVID-19 that requires the use of face masks on conveyances (e.g., planes, trains, and buses)  and at transportation hubs.Further, the bill nullifies (1) the emergency&nbsp;order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on January 29, 2021, that mandates such use of face masks on public and commercial&nbsp;conveyances and at transportation hubs,&nbsp;and (2) orders and directives of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) that relate to the CDC order.As background, the CDC and TSA ceased enforcement of the emergency order&nbsp;following an April 18, 2022, court order. Further, the COVID-19 public health emergency expired on May 11, 2023. Freedom to Petition the Government ActThis bill allows outside nonprofit organizations to meet with federal officials in the District of Columbia (DC) on federal property without having to register as businesses in DC. Currently, entities that are formed outside of DC, including nonprofit organizations, must generally register with DC before doing business in DC. Under the bill, outside nonprofit organizations  may meet with&nbsp;federal government officials at federally leased or owned buildings in DC without having to register.&nbsp; TBI and PTSD Treatment Act This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to furnish hyperbaric oxygen therapy through a provider authorized by the Veterans Community Care Program to veterans who have a traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder. Armed Forces Endangered Species Exemption ActThis bill establishes exemptions from the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) for defense-related operations.First, the bill prohibits the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&nbsp;(FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) from designating military installations or state-owned National Guard installations as critical habitat under the ESA. It also prohibits FWS and NMFS&nbsp;from designating other lands, waters, or geographical areas as critical habitats if the Department of Defense (DOD) determines that the areas are necessary for military training, weapons testing, or other reasons. While DOD must submit such determinations in writing to the FWS, DOD is not required to consult with the FWS&nbsp;under the ESA about such determinations.&nbsp;Next, the bill exempts military personnel&nbsp;engaged in national defense-related operations (actions or duties that DOD deems necessary to support its mission) from ESA prohibitions on (1) taking (e.g., harming or killing) of&nbsp;endangered species or threatened species; (2) importing or exporting such species; and (3) damaging, destroying, removing, cutting, or digging up such species. Further, the bill exempts any injury to or mortality of a threatened or endangered species that results from, but is not the purpose of, a national defense-related operation.The term military personnel means&nbsp;a member of the Armed Forces&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;a civilian employee or contractor of (1) DOD; or (2) any other federal agency,&nbsp;or any provisional authority, to the extent such employment relates to supporting the mission of DOD overseas. Prescription Freedom Act of 2025This bill generally eliminates the authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require that a drug be dispensed only with a prescription. However, the FDA may continue to require a prescription for any drug intended for terminating a pregnancy. Keeping Aid for Municipalities And Localities Accountable Act or the KAMALA ActThis bill prohibits the use of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding to assist non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who are not lawfully admitted permanent residents. The CDBG program is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and provides states, local governments, and Indian tribes with funds for economic and community development.The bill also specifically prohibits HUD from making a CDBG grant to any state, local government, or Indian tribe that carries out a housing or community development program that assists such individuals.&nbsp; Increasing Public Access to Recreation ActThis bill increases the amount made available from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for recreational public access projects on federal land. Stop Woke Investing ActThis bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to amend regulations to limit the inclusion of shareholder proposals in proxy statements. A proxy statement is provided to shareholders prior to a public company holding a shareholder meeting and contains information relevant to a shareholder vote. Under current SEC rules, certain qualifying shareholder proposals must be included on a company's proxy statement, including proposals that raise significant social policy issues.Under the bill, a shareholder proposal must have a material effect on the financial performance of the company to be included in a proxy statement. The bill also establishes a cap on the number of shareholder proposals required to be included in a shareholder meeting, depending on the size and type of the company. In addition, a proposal submitted by a member of the board of directors is prohibited from inclusion as a shareholder proposal. Medical Innovation Acceleration Act of 2025This bill exempts noninvasive diagnostic devices from the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration.The bill defines noninvasive diagnostic device as one that does not penetrate the skin or any other membrane of the body, is not inserted or implanted into the body, causes no more than ephemeral compression or temperature changes to in situ bodily tissues, and does not subject bodily tissues to ionizing radiation. Freedom for Farmers Act of 2025This bill abolishes the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Currently, this agency, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), investigates and responds to environmental exposures to hazardous substances in communities. The bill requires HHS to transfer authority regarding certain national disease and toxic exposure registries to another appropriate HHS entity. Mens Rea Reform Act of 2025This bill establishes a default mens rea standard (i.e., state of mind requirement) for federal criminal offenses—statutory and regulatory—that lack an explicit standard.The government must generally prove that a defendant acted knowingly with respect to each element of an offense for which the text does not specify a state of mind.&nbsp; Ending Common Core and Expanding School Choice Act This bill&nbsp;revises requirements&nbsp;related to federal&nbsp;education funding for disadvantaged children. Specifically, the bill (1)&nbsp;eliminates the standards, assessments, and academic accountability requirements for state and local educational agencies that receive federal funds for the education of disadvantaged children; (2) requires such funds to be allocated based on the number of children residing in each state who are living in poverty; and (3) allows educational agencies to distribute per-pupil amounts from such funds to parents for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses. The bill prohibits federal officers or employees from mandating academic standards, assessments, curricula, or accountability systems. Space Research Innovation ActThis bill directs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to establish a university-affiliated research center to fund analyses and engineering support related to cislunar and deep&nbsp;space missions and interplanetary research. Entities eligible to participate in the center include institutions of higher education, operators of federally funded research and development centers, and nonprofit research institutions. Limiting Emergency Powers Act of 2025This bill terminates&nbsp;any national emergency declared by the President 30 days after the declaration unless a joint resolution affirming the declaration is enacted. All national emergency declarations expire after two years&nbsp;unless the President requests a renewal and a joint resolution affirming the renewal is enacted. Grant's LawThis bill requires the Department of Justice to detain a non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) found to be unlawfully present in the United States and arrested for various crimes that would render the individual deportable or inadmissible.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may release the individual to an appropriate authority for proceedings related to the arrest, but DHS must resume custody for any period that the individual is not in such authority's custody.If the individual is not convicted of crimes for which the individual was arrested, DHS must continue to detain the individual until removal proceedings are completed. DHS must complete such removal proceedings within 90 days. No Federal Funds for Political Prosecutions ActThis bill specifies that no funds or property received through equitable sharing by a state or local law enforcement agency with the authority to prosecute a criminal case may be used to investigate or prosecute a current or former President or Vice President, or a candidate for the office of President. Ensuring United Families at the Border ActThis bill addresses the treatment of children who are non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law), including by statutorily establishing that there is no presumption that such a child (other than an unaccompanied child) should not be detained for immigration purposes.Specifically, the bill states that the detention of such minors shall be governed by specified sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act and not any other provision of law, judicial ruling, or settlement agreement.(A 1997 settlement agreement, commonly known as the Flores agreement, imposes requirements relating to the treatment of detained alien minors, including requiring such minors to be released or placed in a nonsecure facility after a certain amount of time in detention.)If an adult enters the United States unlawfully with their child, the Department of Homeland Security must detain the adult and child together if the only criminal charge against the adult is a misdemeanor for unlawful entry.This bill also prohibits states from imposing licensing requirements on immigration detention facilities used to detain minors or families with minors. This bill provides a tax deduction for health insurance premiums paid to provide medical insurance coverage for an individual, the individual’s spouse, and the individual’s dependents. Under the bill, the tax deduction may be claimed as an adjustment to income (also known as an above-the-line tax deduction), which does not require the individual to itemize deductions.&nbsp; Voter Integrity Protection Act This bill imposes additional immigration-related penalties for non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who vote in an election for federal office.  It shall be an aggravated felony for a non-U.S. national who is unlawfully present to violate an existing prohibition against a non-U.S. national voting in a federal election. (An aggravated felony conviction carries various immigration consequences, such as rendering the non-U.S. national inadmissible, deportable, and barred from establishing good moral character for naturalization.) A non-U.S. national who is unlawfully present and who knowingly violates the prohibition against voting in a federal election shall be deportable. Ending Catch and Release Act of 2025This bill changes the treatment of certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) without lawful immigration status, including by prohibiting the release of asylum seekers into the United States while their cases are pending.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may not (with some exceptions) release an individual who is not clearly entitled to admission into the United States while the individual's case is pending, even if the individual is an asylum seeker. DHS may instead detain the individual or return the individual to a neighboring country in certain situations.The bill also expands expedited removal from the United States (i.e., removal without further hearing or review) to include individuals present in the United States without being admitted, with certain exceptions. Under current law, individuals are subject to expedited removal if they lack proper documentation or obtained an immigration benefit through fraud; such individuals are still subject to expedited removal under the bill.The bill also modifies the standard for establishing a credible fear of persecution to avoid expedited removal. Generally, an asylum seeker may avoid expedited removal if an asylum officer finds such a credible fear. Under this bill, an officer may find credible fear if it is more likely than not the individual can establish their eligibility for asylum, whereas under current law, the officer may find credible fear if there is a significant possibility that the individual can establish their eligibility. Small Business Flexibility ActThis bill provides&nbsp;statutory authority for the pooling of tips among&nbsp;two pools of employees. The first pool consists of employees who&nbsp;customarily and regularly receive tips&nbsp;(as is permitted under the current statute). The second pool consists of&nbsp;(1) employees who&nbsp;customarily and regularly receive tips and are paid at least minimum wage, and (2) employees who&nbsp;do not customarily and regularly receive tips.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fund and Complete the Border Wall ActThis bill establishes funding for a U.S.-Mexico border barrier and revises how border patrol agents are compensated for overtime.The Department of the Treasury shall set up an account for funding the design, construction, and maintenance of the barrier. The funds in the account are appropriated only for that purpose and for vehicles and equipment for border patrol agents.For each fiscal year, financial assistance to a country shall be reduced by $2,000 for each citizen or national of that country apprehended for illegally entering the United States through its southern border. The reduced amount shall be transferred to the border barrier account. The Department of State may opt not to reduce amounts appropriated to Mexico for various military and law enforcement-related activities.This bill establishes a 5% fee on foreign remittance transfers and increases the fee for the arrival/departure I-94 form for various aliens entering the United States, with part of the fees going to the border barrier account.By December 31, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security shall (1) take all actions necessary, including constructing barriers, to prevent illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico barrier; and (2) achieve operational control over all U.S. international borders.The bill changes how border patrol agents receive overtime pay when working up to 100 hours in a two-week period. For hours worked above 80, an agent shall receive at least 150% of the agent's regular hourly rate. One Bill, One Subject Transparency ActThis bill prohibits any bill or joint resolution from addressing more than one subject and establishes related enforcement mechanisms.The bill requires bills and joint resolutions to address only one subject, which must be clearly and descriptively expressed in the bill or joint resolution's title. Appropriations bills may only contain provisions that are germane to the subject matter of the underlying bill.&nbsp;However, appropriations bills may limit&nbsp;the expenditure of appropriated funds.The bill voids&nbsp;any act (i.e., law) or joint resolution with a title that addresses two or more unrelated subjects;any provision of an act or joint resolution concerning a subject that is not clearly and descriptively expressed in the title;any provision of an appropriations act that contains general legislation or change of existing law provision not germane to the subject matter of the underlying bill;any provision of an appropriations act that addresses a subject outside of the jurisdiction of the relevant subcommittee of the Committees on Appropriations of the House and of the Senate.The bill also authorizes any person aggrieved by the enforcement or threat of enforcement of an act enacted after this bill that does not comply with the requirements of this bill&nbsp;to sue the United States. Native American Education Opportunity Act This bill addresses education savings account programs and charter schools for tribal students.  Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Education and the Department of the Interior, at the request of federally recognized Indian tribes, to&nbsp;provide funds to tribes for tribal-based education savings account programs. Tribes must use these funds to award grants to education savings accounts for students who (1)&nbsp;attended or will be eligible to attend a school operated by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE); or (2) will not be attending a school operated by the BIE, receiving an education savings account from another tribe, or attending public elementary or secondary school while participating in the program. Funds may be used for items and activities such as costs of attendance at private schools, private tutoring and online learning programs, textbooks, educational software, or examination fees.  The Government Accountability Office must review the implementation of these education savings account programs, including any factors impacting increased participation in such programs. Additionally, the bill authorizes the BIE to approve and fund charter schools at any school that it operates or funds. Health Coverage Choice ActThis bill extends the maximum duration of short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans. The bill increases the maximum authorized initial term of such plans to a period that is less than 12 months (with a total duration of no more than 36 months, including renewals).Current regulations limit the initial term to no more than three months and the maximum coverage duration to no more than four months, including renewals or extensions. Defund National Endowment for the Humanities Act&nbsp;of 2025This bill prohibits the use of any funds that are made available to the National Endowment for the Humanities of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities to carry out the functions, programs, or activities of such endowment. Accountability for Lawless Violence In our Neighborhoods Act or the ALVIN ActThis bill prohibits federal funds from being awarded or otherwise made available to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office in New York.&nbsp;The bill also (1) rescinds any unobligated funds that were allocated for or otherwise made available to the office, and (2) directs the Department of Justice to require the office to reimburse the federal government for all funds that were expended for the office after January 1, 2022. Withholding Investments from Lawless Litigators In States Act or the WILLIS ActThis bill prohibits federal funds from being awarded or otherwise made available to the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office in Georgia.&nbsp;The bill also (1) rescinds any unobligated funds that were allocated for or otherwise made available to the office, and (2) directs the Department of Justice to require the office to reimburse the federal government for all funds that were expended for the office after January 1, 2021. Freedom from Mandates ActThis bill nullifies certain executive orders regarding COVID-19 safety and prohibits the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services (HHS) from taking specified actions with respect to vaccination against COVID-19.Specifically, the bill nullifies Executive Order 14042 (relating to ensuring adequate COVID-19 safety protocols for federal contractors) and Executive Order 14043 (requiring COVID-19 vaccination for federal employees).Labor may not issue any rule requiring employers to mandate vaccination of employees against COVID-19 or requiring testing of employees who are unvaccinated.HHS may not (1) require a health care provider, as a condition of participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program, to mandate vaccination of employees against COVID-19 or require testing of employees who are unvaccinated; or (2) otherwise penalize such a provider for failure to mandate such vaccination or require such testing. Nullify Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act or the NOSHA ActThis bill abolishes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and its functions. OSHA, which is part of the Department of Labor, sets and enforces workplace safety and health standards and provides related training, outreach, education, and assistance. Pregnant Women Health and Safety Act of 2025This bill establishes requirements for physicians who perform abortions and abortion clinics.Specifically, the bill requires a physician who performs an abortion (1) to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital; and (2) at the time of the abortion, to notify the patient of the hospital location where the patient can receive follow-up care if complications arise.A physician who fails to comply is subject to criminal penalties—a fine, a prison term of up to two years, or both. A woman who undergoes an abortion may not be prosecuted.The bill also requires an abortion clinic, in order to receive federal funds or assistance, to (1) be licensed by the state in which it is located, and (2) be in compliance with federal standards for ambulatory surgical centers.

Responsible Path to Full Obamacare Repeal ActThis bill repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, effective at the beginning of FY2026. Provisions of law amended by those acts are restored. Abortion Is Not Health Care Act of 2025This bill excludes amounts paid for an abortion from the itemized tax deduction for qualified medical and dental expenses.&nbsp;Under current law, individuals who itemize their tax deductions may deduct qualified medical and dental expenses to the extent that such expenses exceed 7.5% of the individual’s adjusted gross income for the tax year. Further, under current law, the calculation of the itemized tax deduction for medical and dental expenses may include amounts paid for a legal abortion.&nbsp; Stop Imposing Woke Ideology Abroad ActThis bill prohibits using federal funds for the Department of State's Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice. (The special representative's duties include leading the State Department's efforts to combat systemic racism and discrimination around the world.)The bill also prohibits using federal funds to implement the State Department's Equity Action Plan. (The plan outlines actions and metrics related to addressing issues of equity, including racial equity, in the State Department's foreign affairs mission.) WHO Withdrawal ActThis bill requires the President to immediately withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) and prohibits using any federal funds to provide for U.S. participation in the WHO.The bill also repeals the 1948 act authorizing the United States to join the WHO. This bill removes Pakistan's designation as a major non-NATO ally, a status that allows for various benefits such as access to excess U.S. defense supplies and participation in cooperative defense research and development projects.The President may not redesignate Pakistan as a major non-NATO ally without certifying that the country has taken various actions against the Haqqani Network, including continuing to conduct military actions against the Taliban-affiliated group and prosecuting its leaders. Transparency and Effective Accountability Measures for Veteran Caregivers Act or the TEAM Veteran Caregivers Act The bill revises the administration of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) caregiver programs. Specifically, the bill requires the VA to formally recognize caregivers of veterans by identifying any caregiver in the health record of the veteran. Such caregivers covered by the bill include those participating in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers and those participating in the Program of General Caregiver Support Services. The bill requires the VA to notify veterans and their caregivers regarding any clinical determinations made relating to claims, tier reduction, or termination of assistance under, or eligibility for, the specified caregiver programs. The notifications must be standardized and contain specified details regarding the decisions. The bill also requires the VA to temporarily extend benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers for at least 90 days after the receipt of notice that a veteran is no longer clinically eligible for the program. Such an extension shall not apply to the termination of caregiver benefits (1) if the VA determines the caregiver committed fraud or abused or neglected the veteran, (2) if another primary provider or individual caregiver is designated within 90 days after the termination, (3) if the terminated individual moves out or abandons their relationship with the veteran, or (4) upon request of the caregiver or veteran.  Improving Science in Chemical Assessments Act This bill modifies procedures related to specified chemical assessments performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Specifically, chemical hazard identification and dose response assessments must be performed by the appropriate EPA program office (they are currently performed by the Integrated Risk Information System program). Additionally, the bill requires the EPA to establish a steering committee to ensure there is no duplication of effort by relevant program offices in conducting covered assessments. Veterans Health Care Freedom Act This bill requires the Center for Innovation for Care and Payment within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement a three-year pilot program to improve the ability of veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system to access hospital care, medical services, and extended care services through the covered care system by providing such veterans with the ability to choose health care providers. Under the bill, the covered care system includes VA medical facilities, health care providers participating in the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP), and eligible entities or providers that have entered into a Veterans Care Agreement. A veteran participating in the program may elect to receive care at any provider in the covered care system. The pilot program removes certain requirements (e.g., location of the veteran) to access care at VA and non-VA facilities. After four years, the bill permanently phases out the requirements for accessing care under the VCCP and Veterans Care Agreements and requires the VA to provide such care under the same conditions of the pilot program. Additionally, after four years, veterans may receive care at a VA medical facility regardless of whether the facility is in the same Veterans Integrated Service Network as the veteran.  This bill repeals the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The act established certain voter registration requirements for federal elections, such as the requirement for states to allow individuals to register to vote when they apply for a driver's license.  Budget Process Enhancement Act This bill modifies the federal budget process to withhold the salaries of Members of Congress and cancel the salaries of certain employees of the Office of Management and Budget when certain budget process requirements are not met. The bill also changes the assumptions that the Congressional Budget Office uses to calculate its baseline for discretionary spending to eliminate certain adjustments for inflation and other factors. (A baseline is a projection of federal spending and receipts during a fiscal year under current law.)  Drain the Intelligence Community Swamp Act of 2025This bill revokes the security clearances of 51 individuals who signed a statement titled Public Statement on the Hunter Biden Emails and dated October 19, 2020. It also (1) specifies that a security clearance may not be granted or renewed for any of them, and (2) requires the Departments of Defense and Justice to investigate these individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This resolution expresses support for women nationwide to have access to comprehensive, convenient, compassionate, life-affirming, and high-quality health care. This resolution expresses that the House of Representatives (1) reaffirms and reiterates its commitment to ensuring secure elections throughout the United States, and (2) recognizes that the presentation of valid photograph identification is a fundamental component of secure elections throughout the United States. This resolution reaffirms that the United States in not a party to the Rome Statute and does not recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). &nbsp;The resolution also (1) condemns the ICC's issuance of arrest warrant applications for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and&nbsp;Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, and (2) supports Israel's right to defend itself and its leaders from unwarranted international legal actions.&nbsp; This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment that prohibits total outlays for any fiscal year from exceeding total receipts for that fiscal year.The amendment also prohibits (1) increases to the federal debt limit, and (2) a bill that increases revenue from becoming law unless the bill has been approved by two-thirds of each chamber of Congress with a roll call vote. This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment requiring the Supreme Court to be composed&nbsp;of nine Justices—one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices."

         "This bill provides that amounts paid for membership in a health care sharing ministry, including amounts paid for the sharing of medical expenses and administrative fees, are a tax-deductible medical expense. (Health care sharing ministries are faith-based organizations with members who share a common set of ethical or religious beliefs and who contribute regular payments to cover the medical expenses of other members.) Interstate Transport Act of 2025This bill permits an individual to&nbsp;transport a knife between two places (e.g., states) where it is legal to possess, carry, or transport the knife.&nbsp;The knife must be transported in compliance with the bill's accessibility and secure storage requirements, unless it is an emergency knife or tool designed to cut seat belts.An individual who is transporting a knife in compliance with this bill may not be arrested for a knife violation unless there is probable cause to believe the individual failed to comply with the accessibility or secure storage requirements. Restoring Access to Mountain Homes ActThis bill authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide Public Assistance (PA) grant funding, under certain conditions, to reimburse government entities covered under the major disaster declaration for North Carolina relating to Tropical Storm Helene for the costs of repairing, replacing, or restoring private roads and bridges damaged by Helene.Under current law, the PA program provides grants for repairing disaster damage to infrastructure owned or legally maintained by government entities (or certain&nbsp;nonprofits). The bill authorizes PA funding for permanent repair work on privately&nbsp;owned and maintained roads and bridges significantly damaged by Helene in North Carolina, as costs incurred by state, tribal, or local governments for such work are eligible for reimbursement. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, under current law, the costs of repairing damage that existed before the disaster are generally ineligible for PA. The bill makes the repair, replacement, or restoration costs eligible for reimbursement under PA regardless of pre-existing condition.Additionally, the bill contains criteria and conditions for reimbursement, including that to be eligible a road or bridge must be used as the sole means of accessing primary residences or essential community services. Reimbursement is under PA’s alternative procedures, and the bill requires&nbsp;FEMA to determine eligible costs based on estimates prepared by engineers.Recipients of funds from&nbsp;FEMA’s Individuals and Households Program (IHP) before the bill’s enactment may use IHP funds for repairs eligible under the bill without those costs counting against their maximum amount of IHP assistance. Protect Our Law enforcement with Immigration Control and Enforcement Act of 2025 or the POLICE Act of 2025This bill makes assaulting a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder a deportable offense.Specifically, the bill makes deportable any non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) who has been convicted of (or admits to have committed) any act that constitutes the essential elements of any offense involving assault of a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder.The Department of Homeland Security must publish annually on its website a report on the number of individuals deported in the previous fiscal year pursuant to this bill."

         "Guaranteeing Reliability through the Interconnection of Dispatchable Power Act or the GRID Power ActThis bill requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue a rule that revises the prioritization and approval process for interconnection requests for dispatchable power projects.&nbsp;(Under the bill, dispatchable power generally refers to an an electric energy generation resource capable of providing known and forecastable electric supply in time intervals necessary to ensure grid reliability.)First, the rule must address the&nbsp;efficiency and effectiveness of the existing procedures&nbsp;for processing interconnection&nbsp;requests for new&nbsp;dispatchable power projects to ensure that new projects that improve grid reliability and resource adequacy can interconnect to the electric grid quickly, cost-effectively, and reliably.&nbsp;Second, the rule must revise the pro forma Large Generator Interconnection Procedures, and the pro forma Large Generator Interconnection Agreement as appropriate,&nbsp;to authorize transmission providers to submit proposals to FERC  to adjust the interconnection queue of the provider to prioritize new dispatchable power projects that will improve grid reliability and resource adequacy by assigning those projects a higher positions in the queue. FERC must review and approve or deny such proposals within 60 days after the proposal is submitted. Awning Safety Act of 2025This bill requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to issue a consumer product safety standard for fixed and freestanding retractable awnings. Specifically, the CPSC must issue a standard to protect against the risk of death or serious injury associated with the awnings, including the risk of death or serious injury related to the awning unexpectedly opening and striking a person while removing the&nbsp;bungee tie-downs for the cover of the awning.&nbsp; Compressed Gas Cylinder Safety and Oversight Improvements Act of 2025 This bill expands the application, testing, and inspection requirements for a foreign manufacturer of cylinders used for transporting hazardous materials in the United States (e.g., compressed gas cylinders).Current regulations&nbsp;require a foreign manufacturer to apply for approval from the&nbsp;Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the Department of Transportation (DOT) for testing such cylinders outside of the United States.&nbsp;The bill requires that, to obtain an approval, a foreign manufacturer must answer in their application specified questions, including whether the manufacturer is or has been subject to various civil or criminal penalties.&nbsp;Further, DOT must establish a process for any interested party to request a reevaluation of an approval for a foreign manufacturer's cylinders to review the accuracy and safety of the manufacturer's actions.DOT must also revise the foreign inspection regulations torequire that annual inspections of foreign manufacturers be carried out if DOT determines there is good cause;specify that a refusal of inspection shall result in the loss of good standing;allow DOT to request testing and production records and random sample testing; andallow for the recovery of the costs of foreign inspections, including travel and time.The bill limits an approval to one year; however, DOT may extend an approval for five years for a manufacturer who meets certain requirements.On an annual basis, DOT must publish a list of approved foreign manufacturers of cylinders on the PHMSA&nbsp;website. Spectrum Coordination ActThis bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to document publicly their interagency coordination efforts with respect to certain spectrum reallocation actions potentially affecting federal spectrum users.&nbsp;Specifically, for any proposal by the FCC to reallocate radio frequency spectrum in a manner anticipated to result in an auction or licensing that may impact federal spectrum use, the NTIA must file certain information in the public docket for the action during the public comment period. Specifically, this filing must include (1) the date on which the FCC notified the NTIA of the proposed action; (2) any federal entities that may be affected by the proposal; (3) the date on which the NTIA notified those entities of the proposal; and (4) a summary of any technical, procedural, or policy concerns of potentially affected federal entities or the NTIA.&nbsp;In the event that the FCC promulgates a final rule involving such a spectrum action, the FCC must publish in the Federal Register along with the final rule an interagency coordination summary describing (1) the date on which the FCC notified the NTIA of the action; and (2) whether the NTIA or any potentially affected federal entity raised concerns regarding the action and, if so, how they were addressed.&nbsp;Separately, the FCC and the NTIA must update the Memorandum of Understanding between them within three years of the bill’s enactment and periodically thereafter. Updates must reflect changing technological, procedural, and policy circumstances. This joint resolution nullifies the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule titled Air Plan Approval; Ohio; Withdrawal of Technical Amendment (90 Fed. Reg. 6811) and published on January 21, 2025. Among other elements, the rule reversed a final rule from November 2020 that removed the Air Nuisance Rule (ANR) from the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP). The EPA determined its original action to remove the ANR was in error, and this rule reinstates the ANR. (Under the Clean Air Act, states must submit SIPs to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. This ANR was included in Ohio’s SIP.) This resolution recognizes domestically produced natural gas as affordable, green, and necessary for the United States to be&nbsp;energy dominant while asserting that the United States should take a broad approach to meet energy needs.&nbsp;It also supports efforts to increase&nbsp;domestic production of natural gas and natural gas infrastructure, identify and remove barriers to the production of natural gas, and expedite the approval of liquefied natural gas export facilities in the United States."

Also, individuals who file taxes using an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) instead of a Social Security number must pay a fee ($300 for each individual on the tax return using an ITIN).The bill restricts eligibility for certain federally&nbsp;funded benefits, including unemployment compensation, supplemental nutrition assistance, and housing benefits, to those eligible to work in the United States. Agencies administering such benefits must use the E-Verify program to confirm the eligibility of applicants for such benefits.This bill also sets fines for non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who improperly enter the United States or overstay their visas. Lulu’s LawThis bill requires the Federal Communications Commission to issue an order explicitly permitting the transmission of wireless emergency alerts to mobile phones in the event of a shark attack.&nbsp;(Under current regulations, authorized government authorities are permitted to send wireless emergency alerts regarding public safety emergencies, including severe weather, missing children, and other threats to life or property.) This concurrent resolution states that, unless it is approved by Congress, the proposed joint interpretation of Annex 14-C of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) prepared by Ambassador Katherine Tai (1) is of no legal effect with respect to the United States or any U.S. person, and (2) cannot be invoked by any federal agency in any legal proceeding nor may a federal agency assert that it has any legal consequences for claims made by a U.S. person.&nbsp;(Annex 14-C of the USMCA concerns certain investment claims under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the agreement which preceded USMCA.) Laken Riley ActThis bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who have been arrested for burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. The bill also authorizes states to sue the federal government for decisions or alleged failures related to immigration enforcement.Under this bill, DHS must detain an individual who (1) is unlawfully present in the United States or did not possess the necessary documents when applying for admission; and (2) has been charged with, arrested for, convicted of, or admits to having committed acts that constitute the essential elements of burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.The bill also authorizes state governments to sue for injunctive relief over certain immigration-related decisions or alleged failures by the federal government if the decision or failure caused the state or its residents harm, including financial harm of more than $100. Specifically, the state government may sue the federal government over adecision to release a non-U.S. national from custody;failure to fulfill requirements relating to inspecting individuals seeking admission into the United States, including requirements related to asylum interviews;failure to fulfill a requirement to stop issuing visas to nationals of a country that unreasonably denies or delays acceptance of nationals of that country;violation of limitations on immigration parole, such as the requirement that parole be granted only on a case-by-case basis; orfailure to detain an individual who has been ordered removed from the United States."

Among other elements, the plan must identify (1) barriers and challenges of members of the Armed Forces who are eligible for counseling under the Transition Assistance Program and veterans in searching or training for employment in the supply chain industry, and (2) challenges that supply chain employers face when recruiting, hiring, or retaining veterans and such members of the Armed Forces.The plan must also recommend specific short- and long-term actions that DOT, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Department of Labor can take to help veterans and such members of the Armed Forces in becoming supply chain employees. Military Helicopter Training Safety Act of 2025This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to report on the feasibility of installing a traffic alert and collision avoidance system in each military rotary-wing aircraft. Additionally, DOD must also report on the feasibility of installing automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast IN (ADS-B IN) capability in each military rotary-wing aircraft. (ADS-B IN generally provides operators of properly equipped aircraft with weather and traffic position information.) Automotive Support Services to Improve Safe Transportation Act of 2025 or the ASSIST Act of 2025This bill expands the definition of medical services for purposes of veterans’ benefits to include additional medically necessary automobile&nbsp;adaptations.
